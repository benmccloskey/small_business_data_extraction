June ,2021,"Someone in the prep kitchen LOVES salt! The mushroom soup, eggplant parm and capellini brushetta was just too salty to enjoy. Why is salt even used when it can be added at home! Sorry, will not try any more of the take-out. The plastic lids on the take-out containers were too large and not secure. The cashier kindly taped them closed. She said it is a continuing problem.",3,TripAdvisor
November,2020,"Great looking store in Warminster but...just like a previous reviewer stated, they screwed up my sandwich order BIG time. I live 20 minutes away, so not like I could return it easily. Ordered an Italian hoagie with oil and vinegar. Got a roast pork hoagie with no tomatoes, loaded with mayo. Completely different. Beware sandwich orders.",1,TripAdvisor

February,2020,"A local gem which also provides specialty Italian food and take away (stromboli), great deli, sandwich shop, cheese department, desserts. They also have a great freezer section with many of their own store made items:soups/sauces/meals. They also offer frequent shopper bonus points. Often stop to bring requested items for family members in New England.",4,TripAdvisor
January,2020,"Countless times I have ordered sandwiches from this location as well as Doylestown. Most times our sandwiches are not made correctly. I ordered a steak sandwich with mozzarella cheese and they charged for a pizza steak. The girl that took my order heard mozzarella and thought it was a pizza steak but I asked for no sauce.Arrived at 5:30 PM to order a hot sandwich and was told the grill is off. Then they overcharge me for something I didn’t get. These people are so disconnected from the customer,. They do not read the order back and then I swear they make it the way the think it should be!!. I live across the street from their store in Warminster and I work 1/2 mile from the one in Doylestown and I refuse to order sandwiches especially for my staff because they think I’m an idiot for ordering from there when they don’t get what they want.Fancy stores, not fancy service by any stretch of the imagination.And one more thing, if you notice the older individuals are taking the money at the registers, they have the young people in the back making the sandwiches. They don’t care if they screw up your lunch or dinner order, but they sure and he’ll make sure they’re sharp enough to take your money.",2,TripAdvisor
January ,2020,"Their special Italian hoagie- TO DIE FOR! I got the ziti out of the freezer... had it tonight-YUM! Whatever you get, it will be great. Weird location, but worth finding it.",5,TripAdvisor
December,2019,"Honestly, so much to love! Deli meats and cheeses, unbelievable selection. Love the sliced pork, cheese (sharp provolone, asiago), pork broth (freezer) & breàd. Tip of the iceberg... prepared food, Italian food/products, made-to-order food. Very friendly helpful staff!!",5,TripAdvisor

November ,2019,"My sister and I organised a party and we had food catered by Altomonte. We dealt with Laura, we couldn’t have done it without her help. I cannot express in words how satisfied we were with everything that Altomonte provided. To start with we ordered at the We also asked for food that was different to their standard catering menu and, again, no problems whatsoever. very last minute, less 24 hours before the event, and Laura had no problems with this.We also asked for food that was different to their standard catering menu and, again, no problems whatsoever.Laura was reassuring and accommodated us and went the extra mile to make us happy. We were let down by another catering company and she totally understood the urgency and importance of being spot on. And she was super spot on. Food was delicious (we are Italians and food lovers and couldn’t fault anything). Everyone complemented us for the food quantity and quality. The pulled pork was outstanding, the farfalle were super delicious, the salmon was succulent, the shells very tasty and I could carry on more and more. Delivery was on time and no issues with anything and the price was very competitive too.
If you are looking for a catering company, don’t waste time researching anywhere else. Look no further than Altomonte. Thanks everyone, life savers!",5,TripAdvisor
October,2019,Had the chicken parm and the baked ziti as a carry out option and it was delicious. Would definitely recommend and would definitely get again.,5,TripAdvisor

July,2019,This is actually Italian food market with freshly made entrées every day and pizza. It does have a small eating area where are you can consume what you purchased but not what I would consider an actual restaurant. The staff is usually very attentive and offers a samples. Many Italian pastas and sauces are availabl,4,TripAdvisor
June ,2019,"First, I have been a infrequent customer at the Doylestown location since it opened.
It has in general been a very good experience.
However on a few occasions there has been things to point out and this, unfortunately, was one. My favorite bread to buy at Altomontes is the round brick oven bread, so delicious when delivered fresh from the bakery, but unfortunately that's not always the case.
When I early this week picked up a loaf, I to be on the sure side, asked the person in the baked gods, if she knew if the bread was fresh that morning, she assured me that, it was always fresh, every day. Not so, the bread was at least one day old, more likely two. I have previously had this happen, and has, by manager on duty, been told , that "" the bread keeps so well "" that they typically put it out for a couple days. When I wrote a complaint on Altomontes web side, it has up to now been ignored, but I guess that's to be expected. Will I recommend Altomontes after the last experience, not so much, and if I do it will be with a caution. Will I not shop there? Not so sure. I will in any case not go there for bread.",2,TripAdvisor
June,2019,"Ordered veal picatta for a family gathering it was delicious! I have shopped there for other occasions to get ingredients for antipasto. They have a huge variety of specialty items, cheeses, olives, etc. and everyone was helpful and friendly. Its is nice to have a market/restaurant like this in the area.",4,TripAdvisor
June,2019,So fresh and delightfully stocked with many goodies to choose from! It’s a favorite of ours! We consider the yogurt parfaits a treat for a hard week at work. Yum!,5,TripAdvisor
June,2019,Authentic Italian — love the breads and sauces. Great selection of meats and delicatessen. Parking available,4,TripAdvisor
May,2019,"Altomonte's will customize your favorite sandwich or salad so you can enjoy it in their onsite dining area. Desserts and wines are available, too. Well Done!!",5,TripAdvisor
May,2019,Yes they have selection and if you are the kind of person who likes to shop at Whole Foods you will find this place a bargain. If you shop at normal grocery stores you will have a hard time justifying the prices other then you feel like going on a splurge. Place fits in perfectly with the she-she class of Doylestown living.,3,TripAdvisor
May,2019,"We love Altimontes. The new store is magnificent and huge. We always went to the original one as well as the store in Warminister. My husbands favorite is to buy the pasta fagiole . It is even better than my homemade. We love all the meats and cheeses . Always fresh and a large variety. We buy lunch meat, sausage and their breads are the best on a weekly basis . Oops forgot the olives and pickles . Mmm good. Highly recommend Altimontes. Forgot they now sell wine",5,TripAdvisor
April,2019,"This is THE go-to place for superb Italian groceries and deli items. Excellent carry-out sandwiches and pizzas, and a nice but very casual sit-down dining area. A bit pricey compared to a typical grocery store, but the quality is well worth it.",5,TripAdvisor
March,2019,This is a fabulous store and we are fortunate to have it near by. The selection is first rate and the service is excellent. Their lunch meat is always good and fairly priced and fresh cut bacon is fabulous in the summer on but sandwiched. Many good things to discover there,5,TripAdvisor
March,2019,"Not sure of the appeal of Altomonte’s for sandwiches/lunch foods. Slow service, average sandwiches, rude staff. Waited over 30 minutes for two mediocre sandwiches, and told by the counter staff “everyone wants their sandwich in five minutes, we’re busy.” Would have been much better off at Wawa; it’s cheaper, faster, and just as good. Maybe this is the place for specialty Italian grocery items, but you will pay a premium over other area markets",3,TripAdvisor
February,2019,"Awesome market. Fresh produce , high quality meats enticmg sandwiches to eat in or take out. Every employee is helpful and cheerful",5,TripAdvisor
February,2019,You’ll literally find anything and everything Italian at this market. They expanded it about a year ago and are now also in the process of hiring a Sommelier too. We absolutely love to shop here and recommend checking Out this family run business when you’re in Doylestown. We have also used them for private catering for our wedding reception and they were top notch on everything and our guests raves about the food. Enjoy!,5,TripAdvisor
January,2019,Thin crust pizza was divine as was the tomato pie. Salads were pre-made and cannolis were pre-filled (horrors!) but there were enough cheese samples to make us forget about it.,1,TripAdvisor
January,2019,I’d heard so much about this place and all the authentic Italian food and products. I was less then impressed with their product selection and even more so with their cooked items. I found them to be mediocre and not seasoned in addition to everything being very overpriced.,4,TripAdvisor
December,2018,I really love this place. I started shopping there as soon as they opened. After a while I noticed that their produce and dome of the vegetables in their deli were not as fresh as I thought they should be. Greens were the biggest issue which lasted less than 1 week. I stopped buying them there. However their bakery is to die for and so are their prepared foods... doesn’t pay to cook when I can get food like that!,5,TripAdvisor
December,2018,Our family has been patronizing this restaurant for a number of years. There food is always beyond reproach. I have yet to have something that wasn’t to my liking. If you are like my family my wife is always stocking the refrigerator with their deli items for quick snacks or meals.,5,TripAdvisor
December,2018,"An absolute go-to boutique Italian grocer. Fantastic selection and quality! Better than the butcher, specialty cheese shop or homemade pasta establishment ... and don’t get me going about their to-due-for tomato pie.",5,TripAdvisor
November,2018,Food is mediocre. Not fantastic as reviews indicate. Purchased lasagne and meatballs. I like layout of store. Easy to shop there. Chocolate chip cookies are divine!,3,TripAdvisor
April,2018,"You will find prepared Italian food to take home and eat, or eat in at their cafe. My favorite food that they make is the Italian hoagie. It is jammed with the highest quality meats, the rolls are perfect and it is prepared just the way you want it. Also, in the market you will find an array of unique items that will not be available in your local grocery chain. That is what I like. It is a bit pricey, but the quality is worth it.",4,TripAdvisor
November,2018,"In November I went to the store in Doylestown pa, and to say the least I was not impressed. The store had a lot of items that were overpriced, but I figured you pay for what you get. Almost 100 dollars later, and an extremely rude staff member, that walked away and stated it wasn't his job to ensure the order was correct. At that point I should of just walked out and never thought of this place again. Needless to say that all six over priced sandwiches were incorrect. There was a lack of meat, an over abundant amount of lettuce, and rolls that were as chewy as bazooka bubble gum. Save yourself the money and go to wawa. My family has worked in customer service, and the food industry and I have never seen such terrible service, as well as food.",1,TripAdvisor
October,2018,This is one of my favorite spots to pick up all kinds of goodies.. anything from great olive oil to fresh pasta's or salami.. there bakery is outstanding..,5,TripAdvisor
August,2018,"This is our go to place to get sandwiches, charcuterie, and sweet treats to take to Peace Valley Park for a picnic. It's also a great place to pick up specialty items if you are entertaining. I wish I could food shop here-but it's a bit pricey for weekly shopping. Going only once in a while makes it a special trip. Don't miss the bakery (macaroons!) and coffees",5,TripAdvisor
September,2018,"Altomonte’s has freshly made dishes such as lasagnas (meat, vegetable, eggplant parm) bell peppers stuffed with a cheesy rice (a family favorite- each one serves two people), delicious meatballs, roasted vegetables and so so so so much more. I’ve never had anything here I didn’t like from their counter. It’s not cheap, but the quality is worth it and it’s less expensive than a restaurant. It’s nice to also be able to pick up a very nice variety of grocery items while there.",5,TripAdvisor
August,2018,"Great place to get authentic italian offerings. Sandwiches, bread, meats, cheeses - everything is delicious. Prices are fair as well. Definitely a go to location for parties and ""sunday"" dinners",5,TripAdvisor
August,2018,"My family and I have ordered sandwiches from here on two occasions. We have used the online option because it is very convenient with a large crowd- you can view the menu, order, and pay online and simply pick up in 20-30 minutes. We got the food and there we some mistakes with options on sandwiches but minor errors. The food is very fresh and the sandwiches had generous portions of meat. We will definitely go back.",4,TripAdvisor
August,2018,If you like to make your own pizza like we do you will love the pizza dough they sell. It is in the frozen showcases. Delicious!!! Better than the crusts sold in the local pizza restaurants. The baked goods are wonderful too! I love the cannoli's,5,TripAdvisor
April,2017,Great place to get real Italian provisions just like my parents would buy back in NYC when I was a child. For Easter they have the traditional Easter Pie that my Dad made I'm Good Friday. I buy one ever year.,5,TripAdvisor
August,2018,"The food is very good but quite expensive. Probably the most expensive Italian food store of its kind in the area. The cheese lasagna is excellent, the pastries are fresh and very special. However, due to the prices, it's not a food store most people would be able to shop in every day.",4,TripAdvisor
July,2018,"Everything is fresh, flavorful and well priced for specialty made items. The deli counter has a wide selection of food, cheeses, pre-made meals and vegetables. Frozen meals are amazing. Desserts are fantastic.",5,TripAdvisor
August,2018,"Stop in for groceries, party specials, or a whole meal. Altomonte's has become our goto place for specialty Italian flavors. Nice selection of fresh meats, cheeses, and lunch or dinner entrees, plus of course desserts!",4,TripAdvisor
November,2017,"It's a good thing they make pizzas and sandwiches here (and sell ready-made to take home foods). By the time you've looked at all the meats, cheeses, produce, packaged goods, your mouth is watering and it's TIME TO EAT NOW! My husband and I shopped late morning one day and lingered in front of the pizza counter for a minute when the young woman behind the counter said, ""What do you want? I'll make it for you!"" It was before lunch and no one else was waiting, so we said, ""How about a breakfast pizza, with an egg?"" And that's what she made us! Hot and fresh out of the oven... it was fabulous!",5,TripAdvisor
February,2018,It's a very complete Italian grocery store and the employees are all very nice. Go for a meal and come away with bags full of stuff to make your meals for the whole week.,5,TripAdvisor
June,2018,"Our hoagie order was mixed up and we did not realize it until we got home late at night. The next day my wife went and suggested they look at ways to improve their process. The counter woman agreed - occasionally orders get mixed up and it should not happen. She suggested talking to the manager. However the manager says that mix-ups happen - it is what it is. Check your order next time. Stunned my wife said to the manager that she was just trying to help. The manager mentioned that the other night it happened - one hoagie was left over at the end of the night. My wife said I bet it was ""my cheese hoagie"" - the manager said yes in fact it was a cheese hoagie. Now Altomonte's will spend thousands of dollars to get customers in the front door but with poor customer service the customer will soon quickly leave out the back door. This is a shame because we like their hoagies - now we go to other places in town.",2,TripAdvisor
June,2018,Best sandwiches around When they get your order right. Go there for lunch occasionally last 2 times they got the order wrong.,3,TripAdvisor
April,2018,"This is always my best bet for a good meal, quick. Not cheap, but when you consider what you get for the price you're paying it's cheaper than most restaurants in the area.",4,TripAdvisor
February,2018,Altomonte's has one of the best selections of Italian foods and my favorite Tuna salad! The amount of homemade Italian specialties is extensive. The bakery is wonderful as well.,5,TripAdvisor
June,2018,"I go to Altemonte’s when I’m looking for something special. I count on them to provide tasty and unique cheeses and gourmet goodies. When I am entertaining, that’s where I can pick up the freshest of ingredients and some good ideas. I highly recommend this store for almost anything you need in fine foods",5,TripAdvisor

May,2018,"I recently had the pleasure of supplying all of the food for my son’s college graduation party and could not have been happier with every aspect. From my initial inquiry when I spoke with Robin through the assistance given by another employee when selecting items and quantities, I could not have asked for friendlier, more professional help. All of our food was ready to pick up on time, packaged very carefully and easy to transport. The food was very well received by all of our guests and most people inquired about the caterer. I definitely plan to use them again in the future and also regularly enjoy their Italian market and the variety of staples, excellent hot and cold prepared meals, baked goods and more.",5,TripAdvisor
May,2018,"My sister-in-law picked up food for Mother's Day. Manicotti, meatballs, and two variations of chicken. I cannot speak to their other items, but I didn't like anything. Given the reviews, I had high hopes. The chicken tasted old and like it had been re-heated several times, meatballs were average at best, and the manicotti tasted like frozen.",2,TripAdvisor
April,2018,"I love this market. The food is always fresh and they have such a large selection of food. I love everything about this place. Surprisingly, I have nothing negative to say about this market. I suggest you stop by and check it out for yourself. The Italian selections are amazing! I honestly prefer this market over Domani Star Restaurant.",5,TripAdvisor
May,2018,My girlfriend stops here often to bring food home for dinner for me. Never disappointed with anything she brings. Food is always delicious.,4,TripAdvisor
April,2018,"From the hot food buffet, to the made to order sandwiches, to the cheeses, you can never go wrong. All the food made here is fresh and flavorful. You can do Italian food shopping or just stop in for a meal. The eat in area is nice as well. The selection is great and the dessert section is awesome.",5,TripAdvisor
April,2018,This is about the market itself not about the eatery. This place isn't exactly inexpensive but it is done right. The cheese selection is superb as are the olives at the olive bar. Nobody in town can slice and package Proscuitto correctly except for these guys/gals. McCaffrey's in the borough - destroys Proscuitto. Altomonte has NEVER given me anything less than perfect. The prepared Chicken Cutlets in the meat section are excellent and a good value - two pieces of thin breast meat breaded and ready to stick in the oven at 400. The grilled vegetables are also excellent. Nothing bad to say about this place - there's a reason you can never find a parking spot there - because it's that good. Be sure to pick up a brick of Pepato cheese - nobody in the area carries it except for them. Angelo Iacovella.,4,TripAdvisor
April,2018,Many selections!! Hard to make my choice. I ended up with a turkey club that was delicious but I should have tried the pizza like my friend did. Luckily we shopped after eating so we were not tempted with everything. I see a return trip just for the Italian market alone!!,4,TripAdvisor
April,2018,"Altomonte's has become my fave place to food shop in Doylestown. Their prepared foods are fantastic - get the salmon lasagna - it's awesome! Great baked goods too. And I love their soups. When we have company, I just go here and save myself a lot of effort - like having my own private caterer. And everyone in the store is friendly and service oriented.",5,TripAdvisor
March,2018,Always a good experience. Love coming here around the holidays. If you enjoy Italian specialty items this is the place to visit.,5,TripAdvisor
March,2018,"There are plenty of good Italian restaurants but this boutique style market is exceptional. Ready made Italian meals and desserts are authentic and tasty. Meat section is more like a butcher with locally sourced options. Excellent cheeses, produce and frozen versions of what is available freshly made. Take out options are plentiful and varied.",5,TripAdvisor
March,2018,This is a great little market with multiple locations. We have been to both Doylestown and Warminster They have a great selection of Italian food and wonderful catering services. The Italian Hoagies are the real deal. Definitely worth the trip.,5,TripAdvisor
February,2018,"Altomonte's is our ""go to"" deli.

The Doylestown location has recently located to a larger store, which includes seating.",5,TripAdvisor
January,2018,"This is a super place for lunch. I’ve been there twice but could eat there every day and probably have something different for weeks! There are so many options. You can select from already prepared salads and sandwiches to sandwiches made to order for you. The wait was minimal both times I was there. Their pizzas are also delicious. My weakness is the bakery! Too many different pastries to mention but all outstanding. Plus, when you’re done eating, go shopping in their grocery section. Fresh cheeses, meats, prepared meals, etc.",5,TripAdvisor
January,2018,Just a wonderful specialty foods store. Not artisan but close. The baked goods and prepared foods are freshly made and never disappoint. For a family of two the small dinner ideas are perfect and the sauce bolognese makes Italian dish prep so easy.,5,TripAdvisor

January,2018,"I don't know why but I was craving a tuna hoagie and I gave them a shot. The electronic ordering can be confusing with the huge number of sandwich choices. They all look great.

December,2017,Altomonte's is the best Italian market in town! You can get from fresh produce to Italian specialties! Get a quick lunch or a meal for dinner!!! Love it!,5,TripAdvisor
December,2017,I stopped in for a quick lunch and opted for the personal pizza which I got with black olives and pepperoni. I was served quickly and had high hopes because it looked really good. The crust was thin but dense and had an unpleasant texture and was hard to chew. The sauce was completely bland and the cheese had an off putting texture and odd texture. The pepperoni and olives were the only enjoyable part of the pizza so I picked them off and ate them and threw out most of the pie. Some of their sandwiches are good but I will never order pizza here again.,1,TripAdvisor
December,2017,"Don’t get me wrong: I’m am happy to have Altomonte’s in the area, but they could be so much better. Perhaps I am spoiled by New York Italian food purveyors, however I believe Altmonte’s quality is only a B grade. What is A grade is the quality and appearance of the produce. The bread, with the exception of the Altamura loaves, is a disappointment. (We stick w Crossroads bakery or make our own.) The meat is of very good quality. The pasta is way overpriced and has low protein, essential for an al dente dish. Go to Bova in Chalfont and buy high protein imported pasta for 25% of the Altmonte price. The cheese department is very good, but pricey. Probably where we find the biggest quality gap is the salumeria. I would gladly pay for higher quality. The owners should take a trip to di Bruno’s or Claudio’s in Philly or di Palo in nyc to see the difference in taste and presentation. We have not had all that much of the prepared foods as we have not been too impressed with what we have had. They do have a large variety of frozen soups that can come in handy as a timesaver. All in all, Altomonte is a good although pricey option, but it is not great. One hopes that with the competition of Simply Fresh, esp in the cheese department, Altomonte will improve.",3,TripAdvisor
November,2017,"Went to Doylestown for a day trip with my S.O. and decided to go here for lunch- Definitely a great choice for a delicious, quick meal! The sandwiches were wonderful with the fresh bread and fresh meats, cheeses, and vegetables. Everything was ready in a short amount of time and everything was delicious. We bought some bread to bring home and even that was still wonderful! Definitely will be coming back soon, but this time to try their pastries!",5,TripAdvisor

October,2017,"We heard all of the excitement about the new Altomonte's. I was very disappointed in the service. We waited over 25 minutes for a sandwich that should have taken less than a quarter of the time. Every time I asked about our number, I got an attitude and an excuse. They kept saying that they were working on it. It was a special from their menu. The store was not crowded, but the staff and manager could not figure out what to do. I was finally leaving the store and I heard someone saying ""somebody was looking for this number."" I got a very NASTY look and attitude from Mike. If they have a hard time doing lunch orders when it is not crowded, how do they handle lunch time during the week. I was also a little disturbed about how messy the store was, especially where you are supposed to eat. It looks as though they need some maintenance done at the store.",2,TripAdvisor
August,2017,"I've been a patron of Altomonte's for a while and we have all enjoyed their many Italian specialties. This summer, I used their catering service, much to my guests' delight.

September,2017,"When I get up to the North end of Doylestown, I make it a point to stop into Altomonte's. The hoagies are the best ever - not just in town - EVER.

I also like the grocery items they stock, some items I cannot get in the standard grocery markets.",4,TripAdvisor

September,2017,"I ""discovered"" this local gem after returning from a long stay in Northern Italy. So many options to enjoy --well prepared food with homemade ingredients. Hot bar, and 3 soups. Plus a lengthy deli that will package portions of pasta dishes and grain salad to heat and eat at home. Bakery celebrates basic ingredients---flour, sugar, eggs, milk with no unpronounceable additives. I happily found fabulous versions of sweets I learned to love in Genoa and Florence. Enjoy an eating excursion to suit any budget and taste. Save the plane fare! Lovely butchered meats, locally sourced.",5,TripAdvisor
September,2017,"Love the Doylestown location, very handy for last minute items. Great cheese selection and very good prepared foods. The only negative is the sandwiches. We called in an order on a recent Sunday for 6 sanwhiches, some wraps, some steak rolls. Beside not getting the order correct ( not a big deal) they were all awful. Hardly ANY turkey on the turkey subs and veggie wrap was soggy, greasy and not edible. But that's OK, will still go there for everthing else!!!!",5,TripAdvisor

September,2017,"Lunch at Altomonte's was great. Two adults were able to split a number 4 Panini which is a large vegetarian Panini. We also got a bag of chips and had a mini San Pellegrino sparkling water. Would definitely eat here again. You place your order you get a ticket for your sandwich and then you pickpick up. There's tables inside or tables outside where you can eat. The handicap parking was near the door and the entire place was readily accessible. A cool place with hot entrées, cold entrées, pizzas, imported cheeses, olive bar and Salumeria - lot of food options to pick from.",5,TripAdvisor
September,2017,I stop here frequently for takeout Hoagies and their Italian Hoagie is superb. I really have not tried any other different sandwiches but many of my friends rave about them.They also have a good selection of pre-prepared foods plus everything you might want as far as Italian specialties are concerned. Very hard for me to drive by without stopping. They also do catering plates and food for parties that is always a hit.,5,TripAdvisor
September,2017,"This is authentic. Real. If you so choose, there's no real need to cook. If you like to cook, there's plenty of wonderful meats and more to select. This family knows and loves food. They have amazing homemade red sauces and more. Using the real deal, San Marzano tomatoes. I will confess that I have spooned it right out of the container anytime day or night, hot or cold. Every product is carefully selected and not what you find everywhere. Under the weather? Try their homemade Pastina. You'll be back.",5,TripAdvisor

August,2017,My family and I love it here! The food is amazing. The selection is incredible and there is always something new to try each time we are there. There hoagie rolls are delicious and we love their pizzas too. Their pound cakes with real butter in the frosting are out of this world. They had this peach one during the summer once that we just had to get. The food is always made quickly and our orders are always correct. It's pretty much a weekly stop for us now!,5,TripAdvisor
September,2017,I never miss a chance to eat some delicious Italian food. This market is huge and you can find a variety of fresh pasta and refrigerated/ frozen dishes to make at home. The hot food bar is great!,4,TripAdvisor
July,2017,"Hard not to eat in or take home, this market is a great antipasto waiting to be created. The hoagies are wonderful and I love the eggplant parm. Best to eat before you go shopping here or you will need help unpacking your groceries. They have a good bakery and as you can imagine they cater. I like this market more than their other one in Warminster. Both have very good quality items. The market is a bustling place so if you are there for lunch and the weather is good, there are outside tables.",5,TripAdvisor
August,2017,"Was feeling sick and on my way back from the doctor's. My husband wanted an Italian hoagie and I was in the mood for a tuna sandwich. Anyway, I asked my husband to stop here. Well he's never been here before so he wasn't sure. We ordered our sandwiches from their kiosk. It was easy. 1, 2, 3 - pick your sandwich, meats, toppings, cheese, etc. I had the chicken salad with lots of hot peppers and my husband had an Italian hoagie with extra meat. First of all the bread was fantastic. A sandwich has to begin with a great roll. Second, they were packed with meat. We also picked up some slices of tomato pie and some dessert. Well we made it home and I loved my sandwich especially since my doc called and told me I had pneumonia. The price was right and now I have a new favorite place for sandwiches. Stop by for everything good. Yum!!",5,TripAdvisor
July,2017,"After a month enjoying Genoa and Cinca Terre region, I discovered this jewel in my Doylestown backyard. Wonderful prepared foods, extensive cheeses, butchered meats with local source options. Wonderful bakery, uses the same ingredients I would at home.
Many options for lunch and dinner to eat on site, or to take home. Small grocery has all the essentials with many ""imported from Italy"" options. Lovely fresh produce section. Frozen options are produced on site. Pizza will not be your fallback for local family style Italian, after you try Altamonte's!",5,TripAdvisor

Delicious prepared foods including tomato pies, sandwiches, etc that are perfect for lunch. Their freezer section is stacked with amazing stuff for catering events- think ravioli, lasagnas, parmagians. Their various to go calzones are easy to heat up at home and are amazing. One star deduction for being a shade expensive and for a cheese section that I think could be more specialized and aided by the presence of a monger. Otherwise, the place is perfect.",4,TripAdvisor

There is a hot bar, as well as a full deli. The prices are very good and the meats are better than the grocery stores. They have daily lunch specials. On Christmas and Easter you can order Italian specialties - the place is mobbed. They have a catering service also. I know I am going to miss something. This is one of my favorite places.

This store was located just up the road and the new store has a great layout a legitimate specialty bakery. a quality but limited butcher shop and of course Italian Deli. They have a lot of prepared dinners, home made soups and coffee. I'm rather spoiled when it comes to Italian food. I consider the prepared foods to be fair. Most people are not as demanding as I and as a result most folks will be happy with their purchases. All in all a nice store that has a lot of pluses; and everyone should check out when in the area. You can eat in or take out but this is primarily a take ou an Italian Deli grocery Bakery Butcher sandwich store.",4,TripAdvisor

There is a nice assortment of sandwiches such as a variety of grilled cheese or hoagies.. There are hot dishes too that you can eat there. They have a cheese counter and prepared foods that you can take home and eat later. There are lots of Italian specialties and everything needed to put together a wonderful Italian feast.

Two hours later I was still in this great place. You name it they have it. Fresh produce, veggies, meats, cheeses, and Italian specialties. The bakery items are just unbelievable. All fresh and consisting of various cookies, Napoleons, Biscotti, Sofogliatelle, Tiramisu. The staff was very helpful as I had several questions about some of the food and the seasonings. I almost forgot to mention that the Eggplant was excellent. Managiare !!!, Managiare !!!",5,TripAdvisor
January,2017,"Over 45 years in business and you can tell why as soon as you taste Altomonte's food. It's clean, it's simple and just delicious. They make their own bread, rolls (semolina are my favorite and the hard, crusty Altamura bread), tomato pie also all the cookies, cakes and pastry. I appreciate their clean labels and use of real buttercream (just make sure you eat it at room temperature otherwise it's like pure butter out of fridge). Their cannoli, pignoli cookies, sfoglaitelle are the best. Altomonte's butcher shop is the only place I will buy meat, the Dry-Aged Hanging Beef is hands-down my favorite but the Certified Piedmontese is also very, very good. Forget going to an over-priced steak-house, when we want a GREAT steak, we have the butchers cut a nice dry-aged prime-quality thick porterhouse and grill it ourselves. That kind of steak would cost upwards of $60 at a steakhouse. Love the sandwiches (chicken cutlet with hot fried peppers please!) and hoagies (Angelo's Monster my fav). Also nice selection or Italian grocery, crazy large variety of extra virgin olive oils and vinegars. Their deli is amazing and usually has 4 or move kinds of prosciutto on hand (san danielle my fav). Great variety of grab-n-go fresh salads and prepared food. I like the Fit Italian Cobb salad with avocado, gogonzola, prosciutto, eggs and balsamic glaze. Pizza was recently added and the Roma crust is outstanding! It looks like it'd be too thick and heavy, but it's NOT! It's airy, light and lots of air bubbles in the dough- like on the streets in Rome! <3",5,TripAdvisor

The newly expanded Altomonte's makes long distance travel no longer necessary. Friendly staff, wonderful homemades of all kinds (soups, dinners) fresh and frozen. Always worth the trip and you can have lunch there while you are at it. We go once or twice per week.",5,TripAdvisor
August,2017,"Shades of the Italian grocery store in Bradley Beach when growing up in the 1950's with a good Italian Bakery thrown in. I felt like a little girl back home going through the aisles and identifying all of the Italian delicacies of old. Beside baked goods, they have prepared food, cheeses, pasta, olive oil, etc, etc. They also have a cafe where you can eat-in. As we were about to embark on a very long drive south, we loaded up with all the sfogliatelle they had currently on display and a few cannoli for the drive. Terrific Italian food from the little we sampled. Very authentic Italian sfogliatelle and cannoli!",5,TripAdvisor

November,2016,"Having been a customer of Altomonte's since their original store was on County Line near York Rd., then following them to their location on York Rd. just off County Line and then their opening of Doylestown I can say without hesitation they are good at what they do. Now, the new store in Doylestown combines all of the good things they have done in the past and added a place to sit and enjoy their offerings. Great cheese selection as well as meats, snacks and much much more.",4,TripAdvisor
October,2016,"The new place is pretty and new looking but I prefer the original. The product is the same but, for example, instead of ordering your hot counter food/sandwiches from a person you now have to use a kiosk - very impersonal. The beef and broccoli rabe and provolone sub is still the bomb. All of the food is still the bomb but no ambiance.",3,TripAdvisor

September,2016,"Altomonte's has top-notch and hard-to-find Italian specialty foods. However, their prices are on the expensive side. Common, brand name items are less expensive at many of the local chain grocery stores. Their ready-to-eat items and frozen pasta are tasty and sandwiches very good. I was glad to see that the store has adopted a system where a customer can pay for their sandwich after ordering and before it is prepared. They did not have such a system in place at the old store and it caused customers to wait lengthy periods of time waiting in line. Warning -- high employee turnover -- sometimes spotty service.",3,TripAdvisor

August,2016,"First - it helps to know that Altomonte's is foremost an Italian market. Their ""restaurant "" is a secondary attraction. Basically, they provide indoor/outdoor cafe seating so you can eat your food while you're there. We usually go there for authentic and imported Italian delicacies to bring home. You name it - they probably have it. And being the bad Italian-American that I am - I can't understand half of the imported packaging since it's mostly in the language of DaVinci, so they have to be good - right? Their prepared foods are fresh & tasty - pasta, eggplant parm, various salads, etc. The sandwiches are probably the best in the area. I recommend the ""Special #2"" - Prosciutto Cotta, Sharp Provolone with roasted red peppers. Hey - I was turned down for a part-time job there and I still patronize them regularly! It's that good.

August,2016,stopped for lunch on a Thursday. The market portion is filled with great looking meats and cheeses. Nice selection and many organic options. They have a good selection of prepared food for lunch. I opted for a sandwich. I saw other people with sandwiches that looked like good rolls. They have a sandwich ordering kiosk similar to Wawa which made ordering easy. There were not many people getting sandwiches at the time I was there. I placed my order and paid for it. returned to wait for my sandwich. about through other people waiting for their order. My sandwich took much longer than I would have expected. Other people seemed to be waiting a long time for simple sandwiches. Finally got my sandwich. the sandwich was very good on the house bread. I would definitely return. Not sure why it takes so long. As I was leaving there were about ten people waiting for their food.

It is a Dtown favorite.,4,TripAdvisor
June,2016,"Great Italian specialty market, recently opened in new, expanded location. The new store has seating for eating in and a sandwich ""bar"" with touch-screen ordering. Sandwiches were a let-down, though, mostly because of the soft, doughy hoagie rolls. They need to improve the quality of the rolls; nothing inside a sandwich can mitigate poor bread. Also, not sure why they would chop up a chicken cutlet for a sandwich instead of serving it whole, but I guess that's just personal preference (although I've never had one like that).",4,TripAdvisor
June,2016,"I like this place, but have to say that it has slipped since moving and expanding. The quality of everything (prepared foods and produce) seems to have slipped. Perhaps they are still figuring out how to deliver excellence in their new, much larger format? I would recommend that they have a couple of general managers, who's only job is walking the place and making sure quality and service remain top notch. I fear a continued slipping.......",4,TripAdvisor
June,2016,"It's bigger and has more selection, but I felt it was very expensive. It was also crazy crowded when I tried it. I'd suggest avoiding lunch time until things calm down a bit. I made the mistake of trying food from the hot bar and it was overpriced and not very good. I'll try something else but for now I give it an average rating.",3,TripAdvisor
June,2016,"Excellent selection of imported Italian specialties, and prepared foods for in store dining or take home",2,TripAdvisor
June,2016,"Wonderful experience, all employees are knowledgeable and very courteous. Restaurant type food available as well as takeout. A large variety of frozen selections are available.",4,TripAdvisor
June,2016,"We were quite surprised at how large this market is. It is a restaurant as well as a specialty grocery store. There are several food options ranging from prepared foods to regular groceries. The prepared foods include pastas, various main courses, salads, pizzas and desserts. The antipasto bar has olives, stuffed peppers and different pickled vegetables. There is also a Piedmontese section where you can buy meats and cheeses. There is a bread section which also has various crackers. All in all there is considerable variety at this spot.",4,TripAdvisor
May,2016,"Always loved their stuff and now their new location just blows me away. Great produce, meats, italian cooking products, terrific prepared food....I could go on. You can dine there as well. Place is lovely. Job well done!",5,TripAdvisor
May,2016,"1st visit to Altomonte's Italian Market and restaurant. Very well stocked market with lots of fresh items. You can also eat there. They have pizza and sandwiches and a variety of fresh dishes (chicken,stuffed peppers, pasta, wings etc),that you can purchase to take out or eat there. Food was tasty and enough variety to please everyone. Prices reasonable.",4,TripAdvisor
May,2016,I like having Altomonte Italian Market as a quick convenience for those times when I need an extra salad or a an extra item. I do a lot of cooking so I don't use the prepared foods often but it is nice to know I could get something quickly if needed. The store is well organized and I like the produce. The cuts of meats are expensive but they look nice. I am delighted to have the new store here in Doylestown.,5,TripAdvisor
May,2016,"Stopped in with our daughter, son-in-law and the four grandchildren for lunch and to check out the grocery items/shopping. We were not disappointed... what a difference from their previous location in Doylestown. The building in very large, neat and nicely organized. The selection of prepared foods in excellent, as is the lunchmeat/deli selections, cheese selections and grocery items ranging from pastas, olive oils, vinegars etc... The Bakery Section is excellent as well. We enjoyed our lunch selections that included Cheesesteaks, French Fries (both regular and curly), Meatball Sandwich, Grilled Cheese Sandwich. The ordering kiosks are a little bit cumbersome and confusing but overall a good experience. Plenty of seating and very nice that there is a small play section in the corner of the dining area to keep the little ones occupied.",5,TripAdvisor
April,2016,This is not a restaurant but has the best of Italian foods.Worth the stop to find that special something for lunch or dinner.

April,2016,"I've always been a fan of Altomonte's but there new store is amazing. They have expanded the grocery section and added all types of new foods. Plus, the eat in restaurant with the expanded hot bar can't be beat. You MUST go there for a sandwich, it's guaranteed to be one of the best sandwiches you will ever have.",5,TripAdvisor
April,2016,"This place is over-rated. Don't get me wrong, it's one of the best Italian deli's in the area but that's not saying much. There are very limited options in bucks county for good Italian food or a good Italian market. My favorite is Pascqualina's on route 113, in blooming glen, near Perkasie. Completely in the middle of nowhere. But I happen to drive by it everyday. Altomonte's is good, especially for the area but growing up in Central/North Jersey, it's just average. People from bucks county don't know what good Italian food is so when they go to Altomonte's they think it's the best because they don't know any better. You won't be disappointed if your looking for good food but it's not as good as all the locals think because they don't know any better.",3,TripAdvisor
March,2016,"Yes, the best Italian in the area BUT I was hoping for a place to shop but the prices just prohibit it. $10 hot bar had boring things and rice... tiny Macaroons $2.50 and other pastries on average a dollar more than the famous Randazzo? Italian Bakery over in NJ, Everything seemed to cost 20% to even 30% more than the norm, pastry to fresh ricotta... veggies also, well over the markets for the same things...and freshness. Nice espresso though and the store is beautiful...go my Italian Yuppie friends GO!",3,TripAdvisor

February,2016,"My family has been purchasing take out dinners, deli and meals on the go from Altomonte's for 9 year and we have yet to be disappointed. When I moved to PA, I missed the Italian food easily accessible on Arthur Ave, we found it here in PA at Altomonte's!!!",5,TripAdvisor

December,2015,"I have never had anything here that is not delicious. They have a deli, prepared meals, frozen pastas, fresh meats and vegetables, their own pasta sauces...We really like the hoagies and strombolis. They are moving their Doylestown store just down the road to a larger building. I'm sure they will have even more to offer!",5,TripAdvisor
June,2015,This is a great place to grab something to eat! I go there often for premade dinner items and usually find something I need in the grocery section! They are expanding into a close by location which will give a wider selection of grocery items!,5,TripAdvisor
December,2015,I Love this place. I have to say I like the Doylestown Store better than Warminster. But both are great. It's a great place to stop for a sandwich or even some pre-made gravy and Pasta for dinner if your in a pinch. The pre-made food in the back of the store is no less than pefect. The are all homemade. But whatever you do don't leave without Tomato Pie. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for something quick and delicious.,5,TripAdvisor

October,2015,A perfect Italian market. Great deli and great prepared Italian foods . A lot of good stuff! I especially like the Italian hoagies.,5,TripAdvisor
September,2015,"The size and price of the hoagie is great. The service is great and the place is neat and clean. My complaint is with the hoagie. They went thru a lot of trouble to use the scrap from the tomato, so I pulled it off and replaced with 1 from my backyard. Although the deli is filled with boarshead, I suspect they used d&w or something cheaper for the meat. A small bit of lettuce was used. A cheap pungent onion slice was used. Glad there was only a few pieces of those. Asked for oil and vinegar, but could not taste any, so I added more when I got home. Asked for salt pepper oragano, but could not taste it, so added some when I got home. Overall a bad experience for this sandwich. Recommend sandwich connection for italian hoagie in doylestown instead.",3,TripAdvisor
January,2015,"This place is ok. It's over-priced for most of the Italian items that you might find at your usual grocery store chain. If you really have a craving for bacala or some cheese or lunchmeat that is authentic imported Italian, then this is your spot. I suggest that if you want to drive a bit farther south, you should visit Sam's Italian Market in Willow Grove area.",3,TripAdvisor

July,2015,"Altomonte's is not a restaurant. But it is the best in its class. It's a meat market, a deli, a bakery.They also make their own soups, sauces, and take out. Try their Tomato Pie! The best! The location on N. Easton Rd. is their second location. The main store which is much larger is located in Warminster on York Rd. I have shopped there for Prime Meats and free range chicken. There are always butchers on duty, and they will customize for their customers. I have bought large briskets, had them split them in half, and then they vacuum-sealed one piece for freezing. I go out of my way to visit the main location so that I have a wider selection and the main butchers to serve me. A unique one-stop shopping experience!",5,TripAdvisor
July,2015,"This is not an eat-in restaurant, but it has the most delicious Italian food! Pre-made food, catering, and also delicious frozen meals. I don't even know what half of the cheeses and meats are, but they are very helpful with answering questions. It's all delicious! The pastries are so fresh. I never leave without food for several meals, special pasta, cheese, and some special candy that my kids love. Something for everyone here. I had never had ""tomato pie"", but I tried it and loved it. That's the thing I love most about coming here. There is always something new to explore.",5,TripAdvisor
June,2015,"When I first moved to Central Bucks County more than 15 years ago, there were no Italian markets. I used to drive all the way to the 9th Street market in South Philadelphia to get some of my groceries. Everything here is wonderful. The service is fantastic, the owners are always engaged with the customers, and the selections of products is excellent. I highly recommend a visit for all things Italian.",5,TripAdvisor

July,2015,"This is a great place to shop for an authentic Italian meal. The cheese selection is extensive, as are the Italian specialties- salads, meats, sauces. They prepare nice take out, great for a picnic, and although I've never tried it my friend Martha swears their chicken pot pie is to die for. They carry a large selection of house made frozen pastas & sauces which are really nice. Working up to the front of the store they are pretty famous for their stromboli, which are stuffed with everything from ham & eggs to the traditional mozzarella & tomato sauce. Lastly, on Sunday mornings they offer what I call ""shrek"" donuts- oversized doughnuts covered in sugar. They make me very happy.",5,TripAdvisor

February,2015,"I am a resident of Doylestown and am very familiar with this little Italian market. First of all there is no indoor seating but I believe there may be 1 or 2 very small tables out front that are available when the weather is nice. They are in the parking lot so I never considered sitting outdoors, but I do frequent this market to get amazing dinner entrees that available in the rear of the store. There are hot items that change regularly and I especially like the parmesan chicken wingettes. The case next to it has ala cart items that are my solution to a delicious meal when I don't feel like cooking. The lasagna, grilled chicken breast, broccoli rage, roasted brussell sprouts, and roasted vegetables are some of my favorites. Next to that case are all kinds of salads and the chicken salad is one of my favorites. You can also order deli sandwiches. Additionally they have a bakery, fresh salads, a deli, grocery items, fresh produce and more. I also use there catering services. So happy we have them in our community!!!! I highly recommend this establishment...dinner is ready!",5,TripAdvisor
February,2015,"I'm a customer who likes to cook. So, I head to Altamonte's for most of my ingredients. Wonderful selection of pastas, olive oil & vinegar. So much else -- olive bar, wonderful cheese selection, coffee, chocolate! Great addition to Doylestown culinary scene!",5,TripAdvisor

January,2015,"I ordered several dishes from Altomonte's for a Christmas gathering. Because I live so close, I got free delivery of my hot, ready to eat food - what a help that was! While the food came a little late (half an hour past the delivery time), it was hot and the man who delivered it brought in in for me. We had Lasagna, Chicken Marsala, Caesar salad, bread (of course!), and a desert tray featuring homemade cannolis. Everything was great, and I really appreciated how much time I did NOT spend in the kitchen. The pricing was reasonable, I need to do this more often for parties!!!",5,TripAdvisor
December,2014,"Authentic Italian delicatessens are becoming more difficult to find. Fortunately Doylestown has one of its own. Wonderful aromas of fresh baked breads, cheeses and meats greet you as you open the door to Altomonte’s and step back in time, maybe invoking pleasant memories of shopping with your mom in similar places as a child. Hopefully you’ll be lucky enough to be there on a day when the chef is making fresh mozzarella or pasta, or they are hanging a 100lb provolone from the ceiling to age. A wide assortment of freshly made Italian food and products from Italy are available. The store also features one of the largest and best selections of foreign and domestic cheeses in the area. And their cannolis are divine!",4,TripAdvisor

Here it is. Terrific cheesesteaks, hoagies, roast pork, roast beef, Stromboli, South Philly style. A great lunch meat selection are very competitive prices. A wonderful selection of pastas, sauces (gravy) wit and without meatballs. We often take advantage of their prepared food section for dinner. Especially when it is my turn to cook. If it's Italian food...it's here. Enjoy.",5,TripAdvisor
December,2014,"We love this place. Nondescript in an off highway semi strip mall area sits a very good deli, sandwich and pizza shop. The service is quick and friendly- they are used to high volume. Shop is fairly small but packs a big punch. Sandwiches- hot pork and hot roast beef with sharp provolone are the best north of South Philly. Big Salad selection - hard to go wrong anywhere in this establishment. Grocery section of fine Italian products including meats is excellent.Highly recommend this shop.",5,TripAdvisor

I recently had a quick lunch outside at their 1 table. Chicken salad, pasta salad and tomato pie. The tomato pie is garbage. Dough is way too thick. The sauce is a solid 8 out of 10. Could it be that I'm a Corropolese girl from way back? Possibly.",4,TripAdvisor

A few weeks back we flew home for the first time since the move and my brother ( probably my sister in law) had the good sense to go to Altomonte's for food for our visit. Assorted hoagies on good, crunchy, seeded rolls (something lacking in Florida) with all the fixings on the side. (hot peppers!) and tomato pie the perfect fix. What a great treat for us. Now I just need to see if they'll ship!",5,TripAdvisor
March,2014,"In the middle of a set-back shopping plaza on a bland commercial thoroughfare, this store is pretty Average. Parking is cramped, with lumbering SUVs carefully avoiding each other. I walked the shelf space, viewed the offerings in the deli/salad counters and gauged the hot takeout fare. I dished into foam boxes a few scoops of grilled potatoes, pasta and sauce. I strolled another loop through, listening to the weekday lunch energy. Business is good. Most of the customers appeared to be regulars. There were a couple of interesting cheese samples with crunchy bread on a small table near the back. I speared a chunk with a toothpick, chatted with staff, then sauntered to the register. This is a to go deli, as there are no tables or seats. They carry the local papers, a nice small town touch. Back to the parking tussle, there is more to and fro as there were cars idling for close-in parking spaces. At the park for Fonthill, the open-to-the-public mansion nearby, (yes, see this quirky attraction) I relished the thought of my lunch from Altomonte's. But, there was no zest, no homemade zing to my choices. After a few uninspiring bites, I placed everything back in the paper bag, never to be touched again, toured Fonthill, and enjoyed the day.",3,TripAdvisor

January,2014,"I will review (also positively) all of the hidden wonders of this fine purveyor later. Why we have bakeries and take-outs in the restaurant reviews, I will never understand. For the moment, let me say this: Altomonte's is now baking authentic Pane Altamura! Not bring it in, but baking it themselves, in a day-and-a half process. If you've been to Italy, you have had this wonderful durum wheat bread with your meals. The next day, however, you have what Americans call ""stale bread"". This why there are such things as ""Crostini"" and Panzanella and all of the wonderful things the Italians do with day old (Italian) bread. If you've been to Italy, and if you've cooked in your own cucina there, you know about this bread. It's here in Bucks county PA USA",5,TripAdvisor
September,2013,We have used the catering service at least 3 times for our church functions. Everything has been delivered as promised and on time. Very professional staff.,5,TripAdvisor
December,2013,"I find their food pretty good but overall fairly pricey which is probably common for a specialty market or deli. unfortunately I also find that the older staff there, assuming the family, all seem to have a chip on their shoulders.
ironically all the younger workers and everyone else seems to be very pleasant. i do not go there to make friends but on the other hand I do not like to get an attitude when I shop in your store. I cannot begin to imagine why these people would be unhappy being born into a Millionaire family and have everything handed to them with a super successful business where you just have to show up, cut the meat and serve.",3,TripAdvisor
November,2013,"Don't be fooled by the outside appearance of this place. Once you open the doors, you are transported into a giant Italian market. The never-ending deli counter begins with unbelievably tasty desserts, followed by a traditional deli stand and ends with a made to order sandwich station. The dessert prices are a bit high, but once you take a bite you will understand why. Anything you can possibly need for an Italian meal can be found here. If you need a party catered with Italian food, do not hesitate to go here. The staff is great, friendly and very accommodating. The only thing that this place doesn't have is seating to eat-in. Outside of that, this place is perfection.",5,TripAdvisor
November,2013,"Somethings from your childhood just never leave you - like the local NY Trattoria or your favorite corner Italian bakery. Whenever one of my relatives visited from NY, the price of admission was a box of Pignoli cookies and a real NY Deli rare roast beef hero (hoagie to us) with butter, salt & pepper on that NY bread (NY bread is unlike any other - they say it is the water). Well, thanks to Altomonte's, I can get more than a few of my favorite things right here in Doylestown or their anchor store in Warrington (a little larger, the Butcher Shoppe is on premises & there is a more robust grocery section).

My only problem with Altomonte's is, well, Altomonte's. I walk in there and I am like a kid in a candy store. I keep reminding myself ""you must maintain self-control"" - all the while being assaulted with delightful aromas wafting about, eye appealing delights staring me down and calling my name, and the sounds of happy fellow customers encouraging me to dive right in and appease my every gastronomical whim. And, so I do. Two of my absolute favorite Specialty sandwiches: (1) my cold sandwich choice - Special # 3 - Thinly sliced prosciutto with roasted peppers & aged sharp provolone; (2) my hot sandwich special - the Italian Roast Pork - thinly sliced roast pork dipped in au jus gravy with aged sharp provolone and a choice of roasted peppers or brocoli rabe depending on my mood. Either sandwich is (to borrow a Guy Fieri witticism) an absolute ""off-the-hook killer sandwich!"" The bakery - there are my Pignoli cookies - jackpot! While in the bakery, how about a loaf of my favorite Semolina bread - soft on the inside with a golden crust and sesame seeds on the outside. OK - I'm losing that self-control - beads of sweat begin to dot my forehead. The Butcher Shoppe is located in Warminster, so call ahead & place your order for Doylestown 24 hours in advance. Their meat selections are first rate in terms of quality, the variety will blow you away and are far beyond whatever you are going to find at your local supermarket. Check out their monthly specials on-line if you are looking for some great deals. Then there are the cheese selections - how about a English Blue Stilton or a Wild Garlic Beemster (indulge - breath mints are at the ready). The olives, salads, and a wide assortment of prepared foods wink at me from their case daring me to turn them down. The only way to overcome these uncontrollable impulses is to call in my order, wear dark glasses, stuff cotton balls deep into my nostrils, stare straight ahead making no eye contact with anyone or anything, go to the register and pay my bill, do an about face and run like a man possessed making sure to never look back. With this new routine, I do tend get some rather strange looks but it is effective (well kind of - sort of)!!! The bottom line is simple - if you want authentic first rate Italian fare, then Altomonte's is the best game in town. They have been at this for over 40 years and it shows ..bravissimo!!!",5,TripAdvisor

Top in the area for an Italian hoagie. Just had the pizza since it's become available at this location and I was thoroughly impressed. The crust has a great flavor, it is thin and has a nice proportion to the cheese as well flavor balance with its sharpness and lightly sweet sauce. Need to try the cheesesteak next.",4,Yelp

It was a decently size steak but they called it a large and it seemed like any other cheesesteak size that most places have. For $12 it was on the pricier side. All the flavors were good but I would have liked a little bit more cheese. Still not bad for for a grocery takeout joint. The Brooklyn slice was also on the pricey side for $3.50. Was a very tasty slice. Crust was light and crispy, sauce was bright and flavorful and it had ample amount of cheese. I did also take home for later the hoagie dip and it was exceptional. I regret not getting the larger size, I shall grab this for sure as I am always by here.",4,Yelp
May,2020,I understand we have a quarantine and we are all in this together but what about a phone in order pick-up line??  Especially when you have people inside milling about like it's the first time they were inside an Italian Market & Delicatessen.  Good amount of well seasoned meat and very tasty extras but not $12.26 good.  The roll was a disgrace for the crowd you appear to be catering to.,4,Yelp

March,2020,Very disappointing. I am in front of the store. And it is closed. Because of the coronaviris they have changed the hours. Nothing wrong with that. But PLEASE why didn't you change it in the website also?!?!? I live 30 minutes from here and I came here just for Altomonte.

December,2020,"I ordered from the preset holiday menu for my family for Christmas. It was chicken piccata, broccoli rabe and vodka sauce penne pasta. I've never posted a restaurant review.  I was so disappointed.  The chicken was so bland, the broccoli rabe was actually gross and the pasta very ordinary. I've never been more disappointed with ordering catered trays for a party.  I have had good experiences with altimontes in the past so I was really surprised. None of my guests complained, but I was embarrassed.  Management should consider a different  holiday meal for their holiday preset menu. It was limited with only three menu options to choose from- I chose unwisely.",1,Yelp
December,2020,"I, had been a customer at this store for over three years. I, have probably spent thousands of dollars on catering for the holidays and special occasions. I, went in one day to purchase a few slices of pizza. The woman at the register was very nice and asked if I wanted them wrapped up? I, asked if I could get a pizza box since I had purchased like 8 pieces. She, said she would have to ask the owner if she could give me a pizza box. Really? All, of the money I spent in this place and you couldn't give me a lousy pizza box. When the lovely cashier came back after like 10 minutes, I was almost begrudgingly given a box.

May,2020,As a long time customer I usually sing the praises of the store.  However if you are using their curbside pick up during the pandemic beware - I have used it three times and each time something has  been of less quality than I would usually expect. Today I got a package of sausage which I ordered but when I got home and opened the bag the meat had an old grey brown color.  Ok that happens - someone wasn't watching but when I sent a picture and e-mail there was no response from the store. So if you use curbside pickup - and spend the extra fees - just be prepared to be disappointed,2,Yelp
January,2021,"I have been going to Altomontes for about 40 years. They have grown bigger but their quality is still the same.  Their homemade tuna and chicken salads and baked ham and roast beef are delicious.  Their butcher meats-filet and ground meat-are top quality. Their baked goods and produce are also good, as well as their homemade dressings and hot sauce. They carry Kreider's milk from Lancaster and it is fresh and stays good for a long time. Their customer service is ""off"" sometimes, but I have overlooked it as the good outweighs the bad--by a lot. Actually, I think they have a new person in the last year in Doylestown, and it seems much better.  During Covid, I've been doing curbside every week (at Doylestown) and have had very few problems. I am grateful that they do the shopping and put it in the car for only $5. If they have questions, they call me. I highly recommend Altomonte's -and I am very selective for our food!",5,Yelp

January,2020,"I arrived at Altomontes this evening at 5:30 PM. I asked them to make a steak sandwich with mozzarella cheese. The young lady that was feverishly cleaning said ""the grill is off"". I then asked them what time they're open till, she said 6:00 PM. Another young lady came over and said I'll check and see if it's still on, it was. I took my slip over to the cash register.The cashier was straightening bags and completely ignoring me. Finally she turned around and noticed my existence. She rang me up, $9.89.. I walked back to wait for my sandwich and looked at one of the menus, a cheesesteak it's supposed to be $9.39. I spoke with the same employee that said the grill was off and she said you ordered a pizza steak. I explained to her that I ordered a plain steak with mozzarella cheese no sauce ( she assumed mozzarella and figured it had sauce) .She argued with me and then I showed her the receipt it said no sauce! She then corrected the slip and I returned to get my $.50 they overcharged me. How did this all happen you may ask, you all probably think I'm nuts or cheap., no!!!  In the past when I would order a pizza steak, with sauce on the side they somehow put it on the steak and on the side and then charge .60 cent on top of that.So I figured I would make it so easy that they couldn't possibly screw that up today, well they did. I won't even discuss when ordering honey mustard on a turkey hoagie, they put yellow mustard. These folks are completely disconnected from the customer AND THEY DO NOT READ BACK the orders when placed!!They sure and heck make their store look fancy, but their customer service is far from it.Read other yelp customers on this thread. The only difference is I continue to go back to the well hoping someday they would just get it right. Another thing I noticed, They have the skilled senior folks carefully taking your money at the registers at their stores but the younger ones are making everyone's food wrong which they're OK with.Today even they couldn't charge me the right amount of money for a sandwich.",1,Yelp

The staff is always friendly and so helpful. ( hiya Angelo).  I shop there weekly and always use my customer appreciation (phone number).  Love my email updates. Doylestown: Also tried the Doylestown store has a much larger presence offering large hot bar and wide variety of meals hot and cold ( warminster store too on a smaller scale) The store is larger, has the deli, bakery etc....   But I prefer my warminster store I know quite a few of the staff and know the layout by heart. The only thing I don't care for it the tomato pie. Too thick and doughy. Gravy has a good taste.

March,2019,"I want to say I am not an avid yelper or a millennial that thinks the world owes me. But, after some continuous issues I've had here I felt the need to share so that maybe the mangement or the owner sees this.This was my go to place for hard to find meats and cheeses but after today I will not be go back. I went in today to get some ground brisket. The place was busy due to them closing for that day in about 30mins but the meat counter was not. I went to the meat fridge and saw no ground brisket out so I asked the butcher behind the counter and for a lbs of ground brisket and he says "" we only ground it when you call ahead"" I was confused because in the past they had no issue doing it while you wait no matter what time it was. I told him I was just here then last Sunday and they did it in 5 mins for me with out hesitation is there any possible way you hook me up .He again with smug voice went on to say ""well its Sunday sooo you need to call ahead and walked away to talk with another employee. It maybe a bit of a hassle to ground up fresh meat but, that's your job as a butcher! In my eyes he was just to lazy and didnt feel like doing it so he made up an excuse instead. I guess that old saying is true it takes years to build up a customer relationship but only one moment to lose them. I will not return here as this is not the first time I was met with bad customer service, there are other places that carry the product I look for that are no where near as local but it's worth the drive if your treated like a normal person not a pest that you want to shoo away.",1,Yelp

They have a huge selection of cheeses and you can't ask anything more than that, their hero sandwiches are by far the best they also have a huge selection of salads and prepared chicken cutlets and they also have their own bakery there which makes all their bread and rolls, I would have to say about 80% of the meals that I prepare I get from Altomonte's also if you're looking for a easy meals they also have prepared hot meals and prepared foods in this location as well they also have a very good and a vast selection of frozen food as well, my favorite is their spinach and cheese manicotti as well as the raviolis, I am thankful that I only live 10 minutes away from this really great Italian market.",5,Yelp

July,2018,This review is for their cookies. My experiences with the other items have been fine. Over the weekend we stopped and picked up a couple of things. Thought I'd try some of their cookies. Bought some Italian wedding cookies. Looking forward to eating when we got home. I cannot believe how freezer burned they were. Inedible. At $16.99/lb I would think they would check their older stock before putting it out to unsuspecting customers. I would have enjoyed Oreos a whole lot more than these disgusting cookies. Don't waste your money. This definitely taints my opinion of Altomonte's.,1,Yelp
July,2018,"I've been going to Warminster for several years.  The last few times at this store I was sadly disappointed.  The Bells and Evans chicken I purchased was bad....the sell by date was fine but not the chicken.  It was spoiled, bad.  Another time the prepared chicken parmigiana was inedible....chewy, grisly.  When I called the owner he was nice but insisted I bring the food back in the store in order to get my money back.  So I did. Also, I've gotten some desserts (cookies, slices of cake) and have been so disappointed.  They weren't so fresh and not what you'd expect at their price level.  I've visited the Doylestown store several times, too.  It's much bigger, busier.  But, I have to say I'm not wowed.  Again, I've gotten stale, dry baked goods here....I don't know what's up with that.  I've tried the cookies, little cakes, tarts, etc.  All went in the trash when I got home.  The meat department seems fine....big selection, clean and well stocked.  The deli is good....fresh cold cuts and various hot and cold foods to go.  But, I've gotten bad cheese there....moldy within days of purchasing it.  I live way too far to drive back there for a return/refund.  For me, it's an overall disappointment.  Both locations are in need of some great quality control and department managers who can supervise what's going on and ensure a higher level of satisfaction to customers who patronize either/both locations.",1,Yelp

October,2017,I eat here a lot. So that in itself is a pretty strong recommendation. It's a high end Italian gourmet market that serves quite a bit of prepared foods. It used to be up the road a bit but moved into more spacious quarters a year or so ago. Great selection of Italian meats cheeses and specialty products. The meats are a bit on the high side and I avoid the fish. I mostly go for lunch and they do a fine job! Home made bread and rolls make their sandwiches better then average for Bucks / Doylestown area. The prices are fine and in general the portions are large. I do have a pet peeve. They have a POS system to order your sandwiches. What a PITA!! The damn thing never works correctly and it's a real pain. I had the same issue at the old store. Come on really?? It's just incredibly frustrating. They are aware of the issue yet it's not taken care of. I don't get it.,4,Yelp

Also they make excellent cheesesteaks when you picked out your own bread in the store. I picked a foot long sesame seeded hoagie roll for my cheesesteak. They have excellent bakery. The only downside is the food preparer didn't followed my written instructions on making my Italian hero hoagie by missing out some ingredients that I asked for it.

I went back again just to give them another chance and they were no longer behind the deli counter, they were on the salad bar. Still soaked in oil and still gross.

August,2014,"Altomonte's is a full-service Italian market on par with any South Philly outpost. Here you will find house-made breads and pastries, fresh pasta, prepared foods, scores of cheeses, and an extensive selection of olive oils and balsamic vinegars. Two of our favorite areas of the store are the butcher shop and the deli.If you seek a bona fide butcher shop, where meat is cheerfully cut (or ground) to order and the beef comes from local farms, then Altomonte's is for you.   Altomonte's is a reliable source for prime, aged beef, including cuts like cowboy ribeye, brisket, filet mignon and prime rib.  The butchers willingly dispense food preparation advice and share their opinions with indecisive shoppers. The store also stocks Amish-raised chicken, and prime aged ribeye chip steak for cheesesteaks. As depicted in the photos, Altomontes has an extensive deli case that includes beautiful imported prosciutto, speck and salume in addition to Altomont's housemade turkey and roast beef.  The deli does carry commercial brands like Boar's Head and Land O' Lakes. Extra-sharp slicing provolone is a fav and always available here.

Their cheese selection is amazing- my husband loves when I bring home new ones to try, but I HAVE to bring provolone home each time.  Theirs is imported from Italy and the best.  I always make sure I grab a container of their homemade olives-Yum!  I love to throw them together with the provolone, cubed up, chopped pepperoni and other salami's, artichoke hearts, and roasted peppers for an anti-pasto. People ask for it every time we have a family party. The fresh meat is top of the line.  Having a butcher in shop is great, you can get whatever cut you need.  I know I don't have to question how fresh it is or if there's any additives when I buy chopped meat at Altomonte's. And their homemade tomato sauces- SO GOOD!  Everyone I've served them to says it's the best ""jarred"" sauce they've ever had. Their bakery items are on par with any Italian Bakery in North Jersey.  We bring two pounds of their assorted cookies to any party and they're always gone in a flash.

Altomonte's has their OWN brand olive oil, unfiltered, most flavorful, with expiration dates on the label.  Tomato paste, yep, it's there.   San Marzano tomatoes for a cooking session at a later date at la casa, at least three brand choices.   I am going to add some pancetta to the bolognese, for salt, for flavor, for wtf, yep, they will slice as requested.  I got some prosciutto for apps, oh boy, three choices, and three price differentials.  I chose the Altomonte brand, done it before, most excellent.  Did I say I needed parmesan reggiano?  Yep, fresh, vacuum packed, very tasty and bitey. On the way out, I grabbed three slices (for the price of two) fresh made tomato pie.

The deli really isn't that much of a deal, I tend to get better deals at BJ's deli counter. But the breads are great, and I love to grab the thin sliced steak/chicken to make cheesesteaks at home. The staff is also very nice.",4,Yelp
June,2011,"A group of us stopped by for sandwiches one day - I can't review the grocery, but the sandwich was fine. Nothing exceptional, unless you count the fact that the regular was about a mile long for roughly $7. Definitely value, with very nice ingredients, especially the salami, on my sort of...classic italian. One of our group had an amusing issue trying to convince the gentleman behind the counter to warm up his roast beef and mozzarella sandwich...they have hot sandwiches, and thus ovens, but this concept befuddled the sandwich artist. The grocery looks nice, with lots of specialty items and baked goods, tomato pies to go (which seem to be a ""thing,"" I've never personally experienced) and very nice looking meats at the butcher counter. If I lived in the area, I think I'd be back again for a quick lunch sandwich.",3,Yelp
October,2011,"My favorite Italian store in the burbs.  It's not 9th Street in South Philly, but it is very good, sufficient and more than adequate, and saves me a 45 minute drive into town. Compared to other Italian stores in the burbs, this beats them by a ton.  Their prices are very reasonable, every day olive oil, the big jar of anchovies, the selection of cheeses, the vinegars, the olives, and where they really excel is their meats.  Get some veal scallopine, or some hot italian sausage, or some NY Strips, or rib eye, all excellent.  Almost as reasonable as a regular grocery store, but the quality far exceeds them. Get a slice of tomato pie for the ride home in the car.  Grab some cheeses and Italian sausage or pepperoni for a snack, buy some frozen ravioli for a quick dinner, pick up some fresh produce, all there for the taking, and all making my mouth water as I type.

Cannoli also very good. We also ordered some fig bar cookies that were very very dry. You'd need a gallon of milk to make them enjoyable. Certainly not worth the $9.51 for .56 lbs. This place is basically not what it once was. Maybe it's a shell (cannoli) of it's greatness.",3,Yelp

I asked him if I could speak to the manager and he said go ahead, clearly not understanding me whatsoever.. I am very patient with people but I’ve run out of patience with Altomontes Doylestown and Warminster.Pretty nice store for the most part and the best lunchmeat on the planet.

Nan,2021,"I work near Altomonte’s and have been a loyal customer for about 2 years or so eating there at least once a week often bringing my fellow employees along. Today like most days I placed my order from the deli and patiently waited for my food to be completed. While I was waiting I noticed an employee making pizza with his mask half down and even with the pandemic I looked past it until the coughing began. The gentleman coughed at least 5 times, mask down and even began to wipe his nose with gloved hands all while preparing a pizza. At that point I attempted to find a manager and was referred to the gentleman who was standing next to the coughing employee during this whole exchange. While he listened to my concerns he made it sound like this was an issue that had happened before  with this employee but he would address it but did not saying much more. To make matters worse after I left I see photos of the pizza guy named chad from less that two months ago in a Google review with his mask in various forms of not being worn properly around food. Even more concerning is the fact chads supervisor watched this all happen in front of customers and said nothing. I will not be returning to your store which is a shame because I love the food you have and I would suspect the people I work with will follow suit. Even without the coronavirus an employee who prepares food with in such an unsanitary manner should not be allowed to continue without correction. This was an absolutely disgusting experience and one I wish never happened.",1,Google

They also carry various wines and beers from Italy, although a bit on the pricey side.

Nan,2019,Great deli and sandwiches. Nice selection of prepared foods and specialty items. It's hard not to love this place!,5,Google
Nan,2019,"Let me first start off by saying, I don't just write about bad experiences.  i have written lots of reviews to help people out as I use Google reviews as a guide.  If a place is outstanding they deserve that recognition.  Altomonte's however is at the furthest end of that spectrum.  I have been here 3 times now.  What I have noticed each time is, this place draws a lot of white collar individuals.  Lots of Mercedes, BMW's, Lexus's in the parking lot.  When you go in, you are overwhelmed by how nice this place looks.  I agree with the other reviewers, some of the rarest Italian meats and cheeses you can find in Bucks county.  But there is just an odd feel to this place.  If you aren't used to this type of market or don't fit the schematics you don't fit in.  Prices are high and again, the clientele is white collar.  I have ordered food here twice.  The last time (about 2 months ago) we ordered a buffalo chicken pizza for dinner.  After reading the reviews I was so excited to try this place.  Once we brought the pizza home however, I was severely disappointed. The pizza was very dry, didn't have a whole lot of sauce on it, and what stood out the most is, it really lacked any flavor.  I don't know how that is possible with pizza.  However, I understand that could have been a fluke and was willing to give it another try.  My family and I visited here again very recently.  Again, right away we felt out of place.  The store closed at 7 this particular night (I didn't know that yet).  We walked in around 6:40 and by the time we ordered our sandwiches and paid it was 6:45.  My young children were hungry and were excited for their dinner.  As my wife waited for our food to come up,  I had them go over and pick a table for us to eat at.  As they sat down I noticed two workers came in and started putting the chairs up on the table.  As the workers got to where we were sitting, they looked at each other as if to say, what do we do?  As I was observing this, I noticed a woman standing at the door with her arms crossed staring our direction.  She and I made eye contact and it wasn't a friendly look.  I got up to talk to my wife as this same worker seemed to find a way to keep looking in my direction staring.  My wife was very uncomfortable with this and suggested we take our order home instead.  I originally said no, as the kids are hungry and we are a paying customer inside an establishment well before closing time.  But as I watched this woman let people out the door with her arms crossed (it wasn't 7 o'clock yet), I didn't want to put my young kids through that uncomfortable experience of feeling rushed.  I went over and told my kids come on, we will eat at home, they were very upset as they were very hungry. At this point I was done with Altomonte's.  Even if our food was the best food we have ever tasted, I wasn't going to go back.  When we did get home and heated our dinners up I will say it tasted better than the pizza, but $10.50 for a hot sandwich is a bit much.  While the sandwich was packed with meat, it still didn't have much flavor.  My wife said her sandwich was ok, but even still we will NEVER visit this place again. The staff that makes the sandwiches and pizza were very nice and helpful, but the cashiers and arm-crossed front end manager ( I suppose) that never smile don't make this a warm and inviting place. I know this place will continue to do well as they are always crowded.  Quite honestly I don't know why when with the exception of a few good workers, customer service is severely lacking here.  I don't care how good you are, if you are in this type of industry, customer service should always be #1 priority.  A sincere smile and thank you go a long way.  Altomonte's doesn't believe in that.  It's just expected people keep coming back to buy their goods.  Well I hope this review helps someone out there from making the same mistake I made but never will again.  We work hard for our money and to give it to low class establishments like this is a travesty.  I will continue to tell as many people as I can about this",1,Google
Nan,2019,"Fantastic food but I've never had an order be correct. The receipts list everything that should be on a sandwhich yet it is wrong every single time, the price is also different every time.

Nan,2019,"I have thought long and hard before writing this review of my experience in the Warminster store. I am a loyal customer of yours for 25 years. I was getting salads at the counter, and as I was there, one of the workers spilled tuna in the macaroni salad. So right before my eyes another worker reached into the case with her hand and scooped the tuna out of the macaroni salad and never changed it out with fresh macaroni salad and continued on as if this was a normal practice of hers! Even though she had gloves. What had she touched prior to that with her gloves? Isn't that a cross-contamination issue? Today with so many people with food allergies why would you do that? The girl said, Katlyn, what are you doing, she responded, its ok don't worry about it! In my opinion it is most definitely not ok! I don't think I will be buying salads from the salad area again!",3,Google
Nan,2019,"We are new to Doylestown, but by far, this market is the best! Btw, people are incredibly nice and sweet in this store, starting from the cashiers, ending with deli, and take out. So I am not getting some comments about rude staff. I feel like there are people out there who after a long tiring day full of stress, let it all out with mean reviews. The staff are incredible and nice people. Maybe because it is my perception after living in NJ for 10 years, but I cannot remember even once being given an attitude.",5,Google

Nan,2019,"One of the worst roast beef hoagies I have ever paid for. Meat was dry and chewy, like when its old and been in fridge for a while. Cheese was put on in little broken pieces, very sparingly, like it was gold leaf they were putting on. Not even a slice for $8.59 for 6""? Rest of toppings were also put on in a very sparingly. First time there and it was very disappointing. To top it off, 20 minute wait for a cold sandwich and it came out wrong not once, but twice.

Big selection of ready to go meals which is very helpful for me. It's a bakery, butcher, sandwich shop, and restaurant all in one! Fresh bread, cookies cakes, meat, pasta dishes, catering, what's not to like. The products are fresh and homemade too. I spent about $80, when I just came for a sandwich! I love their fresh pasta, marina sauce, and the meatballs were terrific (guess you now know what my dinner was that night). I also really like the daily lunch specials too! Some items are a bit pricey, but I don't mind spending a little more for quality food which this place is all about. Definitely will be back!!",4,Google

I noticed it was taking a bit long so I went to the pick up counter and asked, after standing there without anyone asking me if I needed anything. I saw that the pizza was a bit over cooked for my liking, it was clearly crunchy. I told the guy and instead of him offering another 2 slices he argued with me telling me that I was wrong. Since when do you tell a customer they are wrong? I then spoke to manager and he wasn't any help. He did not offer to make two more slices. I ended up getting a stuffed artichoke and it was mediocre at best. I wouldn't NEVER recommend this place, it is over rated!",1,Google

Nan,2015,"The first thing that hits you when you walk into Altomonte's is the scent, that indefinable mix of deli and fresh bread and hot bar and herbs and...  Mmmmm.  Altomonte's has been a fav of my husband's family since the very first little store down in Warminster. His very Italian grandmother would exchange pleasantries with the owner while making a deli order, and shopping for big Sunday dinners con la famiglia. Then came the larger store on York Rd, and now the second store in Doylestown. The larger store in Warminster is worth the trip for it's pasta and deli selection, But BOTH stores make excellent deli sandwiches and carry Altomonte's Italian breads (oh, that crust!) wonderful soups and frozen meals. Avoiding the kitchen in summer heat? Pick up a roasted pork sandwich with provolone and broccoli rabe, or pasta tossed with bruschetta. In winter stock up on frozen soups - the Tuscan bean makes a great meal with a salad and a hunk of crusty ciabatta bread. But then there's the stracciatella or Italian wedding soups. They have stuffed red peppers, but bring your appettite. They're stuffed with a rich risotto like filling and covered with fontina cheese. Yum. In fact, yum is the word. Yum is the word for the sauces, olives, risottos. Yum is the word for the choice of cheeses and fresh meats, pastas and side dishes. Yum is the word for the candy and nibbly tidbits by the register. Great is the word for the service, selection and quality you get. I asked my hubby what his favorite thing is about Altomonte's. He grinned and said, 'They're Italian!"" Indeed, they are.

I'm sure it's an honest mistake but their lack of quality control and reaction when I brought it back to the store is disappointing. The 1st time I just served the 'mistake' (Beef Stew instead of Beef Barley soup) but the this time I was annoyed that it happened again and we didn't want the stew. They made me feel like it was my fault and weren't apologetic for the trouble. They asked for my receipt several times which I didn't keep since it had been in my freezer for a few days before I went to thaw and serve it.

All 3 were put on my sandwich in excess, as I got out to my car to open my sandwich and saw it was incorrect I went back inside and asked to have another one made, the gentleman behind the deli counter walked away and came back with someone else to inspect my sandwich and told me the correct amounts of product were put on the sandwich as per my order. He said he would have them make me another sandwich but I would have to wait for them to make the others before me after they completely made my sandwich incorrectly and I waited nearly 25 mins for the first one and the chicken cutlet was cold, not hot and cut up into these tiny little pieces, never seen that before.

The hot bar now is continually fresh, and rotates things like wings, pastas, vegetables always making it a place to get a quick dinner. What has taken Altomontes up a notch is that they now sell select Italian wines and beers making it one of the few places around where you can get food and alcoholic beverages all in one place.

The sandwiches, including great roast pork with long hots, italian hoagies with sharp provolone, are as good as anything you will get in Center CIty. Their hot bar on the other hand leaves something to be desired. Under hot lamps, the food is barely warm, costs 7.99 a lb and is very ordinary. I got some spaghetti with tomato basil sauce, added two small chunks of italian sausage, and some peppers and onions all from the hot bar and it cost seven dollars. The food by the time I got to the cafe was tepid. I shouldn't have to reheat the food in the microwave before sitting down to eat.

True Italian Cannoli Shells are NOT supposed to be that THICK!  The Cannoli Cream is Totally Lost in a mouthful of THICK Shell. The Cannoli Shell MUST be thin to allow the full Flavor and Texture of the Cannoli Cream to fill the mouth.  Please CORRECT this Travesty and make a True Italian Cannoli... Christmas is almost here and I'd like to show family members what an Authentic Italian Cannoli tastes like!,2,Yelp
August,2019,"Hadn't been here in a while and was disappointed to see that our favorite ""football rolls"" are noticeably smaller than they used to be.

January,2019,"So disappointing. Been here several times as it has the look and feel of an upscale grocery store.  Mostly it's an overpriced average store, almost like Aldis! I ordered a custom grilled cheese.  It Wasn't even grilled! It's like they lightly toasted the bread separately, then melted the whole thing in a micro. Also, their set up for kids play is awesome, but too many parents leave their kids there unattended while mom or dad shops. Seems ideal for a child snatcher.  I was quite uncomfortable watching. Olives and cakes were just like Shop rite. Save your money!",2,Yelp
January,2018,"I was down yesterday visiting my grandparents and my grandma recommended I try this place for lunch. She knows I love my Italian delis. Anyway, I walk in and this place is rather large and gives off the feel of a supermarket. Now I loved how you order. Basically the same as a Wawa where you go to a kiosk and just pick and choose what you want. I don't mind that at all. But I was disappointed that the way the sandwich was prepared is just like Wawa where they are just stuffing the ingredients in. I'll give it to them-the quality of the fresh mozzarella and the meats were dynamite. Everything was fresh. But when you take a bite of a sandwich you want to taste all the ingredients in each bite and you don't want stuff flying out. Unfortunately, that's what happened with how the sandwich was prepared. All the employees were super nice and attentive. Overall this was a great recommendation and I definitely will be going back to try again.",4,Yelp

December,2018,"My review is only based on their tomato pie. It was ok. I did not like the fermented tomato sauce and the thick doughy dough. The sauce tasted bland with a fermented flavor that did not impress. I brought the pie to a party of not very picky people and most people liked it but did not seem to love it. People ate it but did not comment much about it. The price was fair for a full sheet. Overall, I prefer the Warminster store because it's a more authentic Italian style market.",3,Yelp

Went during the afternoon and there were so many people in line for the deli/prepared foods and only two workers. There was a whole crowd of us and there were no number tickets so they just kept saying next but it's honestly an awful system judging who was being helped who was next, etc. I do like that they have the ordering kiosks for hot food. I was worried though because mine didn't print a ticket to pay for my food but everyone ahead of me had pre-paid. I think they need to re-work some areas of the store and not just depend upon the fact that people like it here and they have decent goods because it's not the most  easiest or pleasant place to shop.",3,Yelp

September,2018,1st and last visit. I ordered a turkey hoagie and it was truly one of the worst hoagies I have ever had. The roll was hard and stale. I was looking forward to enjoying a high quality turkey meat and the turkey was terrible. I've had a better hoagie from Wawa! I also purchased a cannoli cup cake and 3 cookies and all were stale and over priced. I couldn't even eat them and they went right in the trash.

This was my 2nd time visit.  But first real look around.  Wow. When I had questions about best favs for gifting -  I was introduced to Maria (maker of gift bags/crates).  She was loaded with suggestions and the reasons behind them.  Also advice, on seasonal finds, best odd, and even shipping suggestions, (not to pick glass items no matter how unusually cute; tins and bottled items here are unique and collectible.) Great Finds. Tiramisu was taste-a-luscious.  Pignoli, divine.  Alfredo sauce better than mine.  They provide it in fridge-fresh and freezer.  They have spumoni, and also tough to find hazelnut filling and pistachio filling in jars. Flavored balsamic glaze. All types of vinegar, oils, sauces, cheeses.  Heavenly picks.Service Friendly. I ran to car to get my bags and Betsy (at register), waited for me.  Then I left my extra money in car and she was never ""put out"", about it;  Always friendly.  Called and talked to manager about what I thought was a cost discrepancy.  We had a few laughs, (Mike).  It was startlingly one of my more favored shopping experiences.   Amazing for self shopping. For gifts. For an Italian home like experience that Olive Garden says they have but it's just words.  Here.  It feels homey. Here, your tastebuds throw a party, the minute you get in the door, and everybody is ready to join you in the five star five senses experience.  Brava.",5,Yelp

Definitely has a real authentic feel of a speciality store hosting a lot of non-traditional food products. Butcher shop is average and not really special. Artisan breads are very limited and runs out quickly, get there early. Reason for the 2 stars, staff, especially the cashiers, rude and not personable what so ever. If you want to experience what we have experienced, go through Nancy's line when you check out. You will love her disinterest and complete lack of customer service. Beware she is a real tiger and will bite you if you ask her any questions!!! Otherwise, they do have great pre-made entrees that are excellent and I highly recommend",2,Yelp

I also really enjoy their pasta e fagoli soup.  So easy and quick to order sandwiches as they have touch kiosks in front of their deli where the sandwiches are made. I also really enjoy their cookies.  They sell a variety of cookies in a box and also by the pound and they are really very good.  Their variety box is what you would think of as your typical ""Italian cookies"" but surprisingly, these ones are actually DELICIOUS! If you buy the by the pound cookies, I highly recommend the ricotta cookies.  I devoured the few I bought in the car on the way home-they didn't even make it back with me!

Their homemade pasta is excellent, as are their homemade salads and turkey breast in the deli area. Their ready made salads are in their refrigerated case and are fresh and great for healthy lunches. Their baked goods, that include ricotta cheese cookies and cannolis, are delicious. They bake their own bread which is also great. If you ever, ever have a problem, the owner is very responsive and will take care of you.  I now started buying fruit there as well, as strawberries were cheaper than Wegmans, and looked great.

Their marinara is more like salsa. The chocolate mousse tasted like the inside of a refrigerator and the cookies we bought were dry and flavorless. Once again Doylestown gets fooled.

August,2016,"Went to altomonte's new-ish location just recently and was kind of disappointed they had not done it better.  Don't get me wrong, I will return back and it was pretty cool but some things were just a little wacky. First of all, I thought they were going to have a really great ""italian style"" coffee and expresso bar; however, all I saw was a little coffee area that didn't really look like it was active or running. Bit disappointed in that 'cause I love me some cappuccino. Also, kind of strange for a store of that size was the drink selection.  Not great. They had an area of cold drink, but I expected niche italian drinks that I had never heard of and didn't see that. On another (kind of random note), I was up for a smoothie and they didn't have smoothies.  Not a huge deal, but to be honest I was kind of bummed out.  
Another thing- There was a bizarre woman there that would not let me alone about cheese.  I was looking at the cheese selection, which was quite impressive and she started literally harassing me about some random type of blue cheese.  It started with me telling her I'm not a fan of blue cheese and her literally going on for 5 minutes about the cheese and the awards that it had gotten.  I know a good amount about cheese and this lady seemed to have tried maybe 3 different kinds in her life. Leave me alone, lady!!  Made me pretty stressed out to be honest.   I do have to say that I like their deli section, even though it is a bit overpriced (what in the store isn't) and they have a nice, casual area to eat your food after you get it from the deli.",3,Yelp

July,2016,I went to the Warminster location of this store and what a disappointment it was!  I had a dry roast beef sandwich which took 10 minutes to get.  The broccoli rabe salad was tasteless as was the cannoli.  The cannoli tasted like it was in the case for over a week!   Will not be returning ever!!,1,Yelp

June,2016,"Altomonte's is one of my go-to places.   Most of the employees are friendly, courteous and helpful. Ah, but not the lady at the bakery/coffee bar. First, she hides behind the big bread case and pretends she does not see you.  When you finally do get her attention, she heaves a heavy sigh and waddles over with a big scowl on her face. When you tell her you want a pound of Italian cookies and begin to tell her how many of each variety you want, she ramps up the annoyance.  But, isn't this her JOB?  She then tries to put in more than what you asked for. At 13 to 14 bucks a pound, that's not nice!  So when you tell her to take back the extra half pound you don't want, she gets really huffy and practically throws your cookies in your face. If this had happened once, I wouldn't  complain. I would chalk it up to maybe she's having a bad day. But, no, every single time. I love Altomonte's cookies. They are my favorite hostess gift. Next time, tho, I am switching to flowers.",2,Yelp
May,2016,"Well I thought I felt spoiled when I go to Wegman's or Fresh Market, but Altomonte's is a cut above the rest. Aside from the warm and inviting decor, they have great selections of meats and brands that are high quality and sometimes gluten free also that you just can't find anywhere else. I don't make steak anymore at home unless I buy from here. I used to have a butcher shop down the street from my house growing up. For the longest time they always occupied the gold standard of meat in my mind. Altomontes meat is just as good and fresh, and if your a carnivore like me you know there is nothing like fresh meat. They also have some lovely chocolates you wont see anywhere else as well. The staff is all smiles and very helpful and friendly. There is also a nice little sit in area to eat, or relax. I love coming here whenever I want something extra flavorful or something prepared already.",5,Yelp

The Bakery Section is excellent as well.  We enjoyed our lunch selections that included Cheesesteaks, French Fries (both regular and curly), Meatball Sandwich, Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  The ordering kiosks are a little bit cumbersome and confusing but overall a good experience.  Plenty of seating and very nice that there is a small play section in the corner of the dining area to keep the little ones occupied.",4,Yelp

May,2016,Beautiful interior and very spacious but HORRENDOUS customer service.  One minute after they closed (6:01 pm) we tried to place an order and a male staff member barked that they were closed.  Another staff member reluctantly helped us.   When she was putting the food items into a box she looked at another staff member and put her fingers to her head and pretended to shoot herself.  Extremely unprofessional and quite upsetting behavior.  It was our first time in the new location and we had planned to purchase food for a large party in a few weeks.  Most certainly will NOT be purchasing from Altomonte's again!,1,Yelp
May,2016,"Traveled 45 minutes to Altemontes new store on 4/6/16 at the suggestion of a local family member and purchased $85 worth of food - most frozen to be  brought home and served at a later date. Last night cooked the ""square medium cheese"" ravioli and placed the previously frozen marinara sauce over it to  serve for dinner.  Ravioli was mislabeled and was not cheese - instead was some type of brown product that smelled fishy - ? tuna. Smelled, looked and tasted horrible so I needed to throw the combined $15 worth of product out. Cereal for dinner. Called store manager this morning ""Robin"" who was nice, admitted that they've had some problems with mislabeling their frozen ravioli but she would not offer the $15 store credit I asked for, said that would have to go through the owner who was not in. ( Why is the owner of a new store not in at 8:45 AM on a Thursday?) I don't want to spend any more time on this and alerted manager that I would post on social media if we could not resolve the problem right then. She was not able to help and could not guarantee that she could even speak to an owner today. She suggested that I do what I needed to do. So, I'm here to report poor attention to detail and poor management if owner not on site and manager not empowered to resolve store errors.   In addition, wouldn't have mentioned it, but bakery area is average at best. Cannoli filling had a ""waxy"" aftertaste and apple pie looked and tasted similar to those served at my local Weis markets. I support small businesses, but won't be back to this one.

March,2016,"Breakfast Sandwich review: Please note that Altomonte's offers many great things and this is only representative of the quality of their breakfast sandwich. I am from NJ originally and have yet to find a place that makes a great breakfast sandwich. I settle with McDonald's most times. But when the new Altomonte's location opened, I thought I'd give them a shot. I guess the fact that they open at 8:30 and not earlier would have been indicative of this being a bad idea. I ordered the 12"" porkroll, egg and cheese (I know, I'm a pig!). I watched them cook the porkroll and egg. Porkroll was on the griddle for MAYBE a minute and I didn't hear any sizzling, so I doubt it was that hot, before they put it on the egg mixture that was on the griddle as well. By the way, many local places seem to use some watered down egg mixture instead of cracking fresh eggs - this makes for a pale yellow, tasteless, wet, protien filled wash cloth, instead of rich, fluffy eggs. So, I got undercooked (granted pork roll can be eaten raw, but no one would dare) breakfast meat, bland eggs and honestly, the cheese was fine. The roll seemed to be not as good as what they typically sell either. I couldn't get through half of the sandwich before feeling like it was going to cause some adverse affects on my stomach, which it did anyway, about 30 min later. If you're going to charge 8 bucks for a sandwich that probably cost less than a dollar to make, it should be with fresh cracked, organic eggs. Also, I'm pretty sure that their porkroll isn't Taylor (from Trenton) either. Nevertheless, cooking the porkroll to a nice sear would be ideal. I think it also goes without saying that the roll should toasted for a minute or two under a broiler or on the griddle. I continue to make the best breakfast sandwiches in Central Bucks County so if anyone wants to have a try of mine let me know!",1,Yelp
March,2016,Great Italian deli and store. Very fresh food and a large variety. Some of the stuff is pricey though. I order lunch from this place about twice a week. The place is popular and busy. Their new location needs help! More staff. More cashiers. More people to assist the crowds of people their recent opening/advertising has drawn in. Pathetic to have to wait in line for 10-12 minutes because the lady moves at a snails pace.,2,Yelp
March,2016,"Wow what a store as we visited Altomonte's new location this weekend really impressive for the short amount of time it seemed to turn it into a store as such knowing it was previously as a car dealership. At first glance I noticed the sandwich area and could not help but be drawn to yes a Montague Pizza oven! Very rare to be seen as it is one of the ultimate & best pizza ovens out there beautiful all stainless with all bricks inside much superior to most of the fake wood fired pizza ovens that just put on a show. This oven can really hold its own to any type of baking! Of course they had my favorite tomato pie a thicker crust pizza (actually bread dough which takes a full day to make) the sauce was outstanding full of fresh flavor that made your taste buds go wow and I even kicked up a notch and got it with the fried long hots and it was only 9:00 am. It went perfect with my double shot of organic espresso. As I waited for my slice to be heated the kind young man informed me that more pizzas were to come as they were still waiting to perfect a more regular thinner crust pizza. He hinted at some special sauces and also a special cheese blend which would be fantastic and different than any other and also many more items would be making their debut once they had their chance to get more accustomed to their new home. Very understandable as knowing the food industry can be very demanding. I also grabbed a few stromboli in the grab and go case as they make for an easy quick meal or snack....the deluxe is my all time favorite. The young man stocking the case said they could not make them fast enough as they were selling out quickly. As I was waiting in the deli line getting my Prosciutto di San Daniele another hard to find authentic Italian specialty which is in my mind the best prosciutto in all of Italy I noticed a great variety of the Home Roasted deli meats which Altomonte's produces in house Roasted Turkey Breast, Roast Pork, Honey Baked Ham and the Roast Beef which I sampled and melted in your mouth with not the slightest taste of processing, all BEEF! Did I mention they also have another 4-5 various other prosciuttos! No one i can ever recall has that many outside of Italy. Culatello another WOW! It is also great that they offer other brands which should please all ages for any type sandwich or lunch! The butcher shop was perfect hanging dry aged beef, Piedmontese Beef, fresh lamb & veal I brought home Hot Italian Chicken Sausagewith fennel, Sausage with Provolone & Brocoli Rabe, Bracioli and the butcher shop meatballs .....perfect no need to make my own anymore. The pasta selection was fantastic the homemade type maccerhoni reminded me of the ones my Nonna used to make by hand every Sunday! You really don't see these everywhere. I could not resist another shot of the organic espresso and a Pistachio cream filled cornetto....it was like crack and may need to break in to fulfill my urge for another. The canolli were also off the charts!
One more compliment as I know the food industry is difficult and producing so many authentic Italian products is not easy but an outstanding job to all the staff on a job well done and cannot wait until you really settle into your new home and make it shine even more! Thank you for putting a great store into place for the many who really understand the work, attitude and love it takes to make a great business succeed with great customers who appreciate it!",5,Yelp
March,2016,"Heard lots of things about this place so my husband and I stopped in to shop. The place looks a lot bigger from the outside. They have a great selection of meats that are decently priced. For an itialian market I was expecting to find various items to buy in their grocery section but most of the items you could buy at your local grocery. Pros are their selection of cheese, prepared items in the freezer and mini food court! Everything looked and tasted great and the prepared meals are priced just right to feed a family of 4-5 for dinner. Oh...and their desserts! So many things I want but not enough calorie allowance in the week!",3,Yelp
March,2016,"New store looks fabulous inside. Very clean. Ordering a sandwich is now exactly like at WaWas -if you like the impersonal method of ordering and many people do, you will like it here.However if you like the family feel of the old location you will miss it as I do. I give it only three stars because I feel it has lost its charm. However the cheesesteak sandwich was very good.",3,Yelp
March,2016,"We visited Altomonte's new location this weekend and were a bit disappointed for several reasons. First of all, I was told by an Altomonte's employee months ago there was going to be a wood fired brick pizza oven making authentic, crip crust, authentic style pizzas. All I found was a standard steel pizza oven wiht no pizza in sight. The only thing they seem to be making is a Philadelphia style ""tomato pie""... essentially a thick, dense focaccia bread with bland tomato sauce on top--served cold. I think not offering an Italian style pizza is missing a big chance. Not everyone likes tomato pie. I was looking forward to stopping in once in a while for a sit down pizza lunch... it won't happen now. I was also disappointed to see their strombolis stored in the same manner as their old store.... in open front chiller cases. They keep SO much stock on the shelves that the turnover in this product must be so slow that what I've tasted goes sour tasting. I won't be buying anything from this display case. We were surprised to see SO many American and ""organic"" products taking up valuable shelf space. Heck... most imported Italian products are organic anyway. I don't need to see Neuman's Own stuff in an Italian specialty shop. We are also sad to see the small selection of Italian flours in such tiny poly bags. How about selling us 5-10 pound bags? There are a LOT of your customers that do their own baking, pizza and pasta making and would buy 000 and semolina flours in larger quantities. And once again, we don't want to come across brands we can find in any supermarket like Hodgson's Mill. There are TWO American cold cut brands--Boar's Head and Deitz and Watson. Of the two, I'd say Boar's head has the better selection of offerings for Italian customers... their Piccolo Prosciutto is very close to Speck. Deitz and Watzon has no place in an Italian deli. I would like to far more of a selection of imported and home made sausages and meats. The selection of pastas is very thin too. How about offering bulk pastas and rice and such, as is the trend in Europe? I would love to be able to buy large bags (or small, if that's all I need for a recipe) of risotto or special shaped pastas by the pound. The coffee bar isn't a real coffee bar. It might have been better placed up in the front where the tables are... along with the bakery. A stand up Italian style bar might have worked too. In the end, the bakery products are not very authentic. I grew up in an area with tons of Italian and German bakeries, both offerings loads of Italian bakery products. The cookies you offer are pretty bland tasting, the rainbow cookies don't look Italian at all, the biscotti look under cooked, and meager selection of cakes look all-American in style. Where are the fruit tortas? Where are the crustatas, cornettos and such? One more criticism... and I hope hope you take my critique to heart. I know Italian food! Your take-out hot dishes are bland and underseasoned and some of the meat products (like the meat lasagna) have a sour off taste. The stuffed pepper was undercooked (the pepper was crispy) and mushy-bland. Where are the spices? My wife's eggplant lasagna and it was amazingly bland and bitter. Eggplant skin should be removed (not all people like its bitterness) and the eggplants really need to be salted to draw out the bitterness. We've encountered this in your old shop and it continues in your new location.  Some recipes are not authentic Italian... or are (pardon me for saying it) are lesser grade family recipes passed down where perhaps they should have just been kept in the family. We were also sad to see American things like meat load clogging up the works, too. One more thing about the way your prepared foods are kept. There are two ways to keep food safe for sale in a business like yours.... either keep it very cold to prevent bacteria growth, or to keep it hot and ready to go, as in a steam table. We bought our prepared dishes for consumption at home and were surprised to find they were ICE COLD when we got them home (a 40 minute ride, btw). They should be HOT, kept in a steam table, ready to eat right in your table area up front. When eating there, I wouldn't appreciate they were cooked once, then chilled in your display case, only to be nuked in a microwave and re-heated. One more pet peeve... Your cheese should be out in the open on a cheese monger's display--open top display case with a dedicated person allowing tasting and cutting per order. Packaging in vacuum plastic has to go. Besides, I've had mold grow VERY fast on your cheeses in the past. Take this criticism kindly. We DO love your store, but see many faults. Perhaps there are too many hands stirring the pot. Perhaps you've always done things that way and would resist change for the better. We DO wish you well and will return as customers to by only select things. Good luck.",2,Yelp
February,2016,"Yum. Never had a bad meal or a bad canoli. Great service & food. About their frozen food, I have only tried their chicken parm and it was good..not great. They have a new place on Old Easton that includes an Italian market. I am excited! I can't wait to go.",4,Yelp
January,2016,"I got some Italian meats here for a party I was hosting and I was not disappointed! Everyone loved my charcuterie board, thanks to Altomonte's fresh meats! I'll be back to try some more of their Italian specialties.",5,Yelp
November,2015,"Don't love EVERY product, but most stuff is good, including their salads and wings. I'm glad they're upsizing. And catering is good, I loved their fruit and yogurt platter as a kid.",4,Yelp
January,2013,Best place in town by far!,5,Yelp
November,2015,"If you want a quality hoagie, homemade blush or vodka sauce, homemade pastas of every kind, and so many homemade sides you can count them, this is the place to go. We've been going here for many many years every time we visit Bucks County. They never disappoint!",5,Yelp
October,2015,Food is good but the prices on everything have gone up way too much over the past year.  Filet Mignon went up a few dollars a pound.  Prepared spaghetti and meatballs went up a few dollars as well.,3,Yelp
August,2015,"If you love Italian cookies you must get a box from Altomonte's bakery counter.  I just picked up a box for visiting guests and they are soooooooooooo good.  Just be careful because you can easily wind up eating many more than you should. I heard that the store is moving to a much larger space just down the road so I'm really looking forward to see what they will add to their offerings. I also found their prices for fresh vegetables, fruits and herbs the same if not less than the supermarket and I love supporting smaller local business.",5,Yelp
July,2015,"This place is a true gem.  I can't believe I didn't know about this for 4 of the 5 years I've lived around this area.  Inside is like a fairy-tale land of deliciousness.  I highly recommend their sandwiches, pasta , tomato pie, and cakes.",5,Yelp
July,2015,This is a great choice for real Italian ingredients in a place where there are few to be had. Their prices are good. The service is nice. I don't like ordering sandwiches from a kiosk like Wawa. And it doesn't work that well. Very worth while.,4,Yelp
July,2015,"This is a true Italian Deli.  They have a huge selection of hose made food, dressings etc.. I only stopped in for lunch so I only got to try the Italian Hoagie.  It was awesome.",5,Yelp
May,2015,"Yep, this place is the real deal. From oil to meats, they've got everything a good Italian could want. And if you start craving food while you're shopping, indulge and grab a chicken parmigiana sub from the deli - you won't be sorry. Everything here is high quality, and makes the ""world food"" section at Wegman's look like Pizza Hut.",5,Yelp
April,2015,"Good little Italian store.. wide variety of foods.. Homemade food is very good.. Service is good, does get busy at times.. The only downside, be wary of the rolls, sometimes they seem to be frozen leftovers..",3,Yelp
March,2015,Seraching for home made food? The chicken parm wrap that I recently ordered here was fantastic! Bought some broccoli rabe to add in and the flavor was second to none. Order ing on one of the two kiosks is a breeze. You can smell the freshness upon entering Altomonte's. Lots of fresh deli items and prepared foods .. Highly recommended.,5,Yelp

August,2014,"Ordered 2 hoagies, the italian hoagie and a caprese with pesto. The rolls were super fresh and the homemade mozzarella was some of the best I'd ever had. Staff was super friendly! Would happily return to try more of their offerings.",5,Yelp
July,2014,"I visited the Doylestown store on Tuesday July 16th. I checked store hours before I went they were open till 7:00 pm. We went in and picked up some Locetelli grated cheese and stopped by the bakery counter and waited there to be waited on, it never happened. Plenty of people around. Two folks behind the counter cleaning up, two cashiers doing relatively nothing, an old guy hanging out by the cashiers with a clip board doing nothing. A girl walked by asked another customer about a cake to be decorated. We finally gave up paid for our cheese and left feeling like we were invisible. Altamonte's needs a manager at this store or a better one at least. The service in Doylestown is absolutely horrible compared to their other store in Warminster. It's a shame as it's a nice store and has almost everything but good  service. No lack of people just lack of management. It was like we were in there at 6:55 NOT 6:15. My advice is go to the Warminster store.",2,Yelp
June,2014,"For an Italian deli/market, Altomonte's covers all the bases as far as I am concerned.   Great deli counter with a wide array of choices.  Fresh bread baked daily.  Outstanding prepared fresh entrees- their eggplant parm, Arancini, soups and salads are all ridiculously good.  Top-notch selection of cheeses and olive oils.   Lots of different brands and prices ranges of tomatoes and dried pastas.   And a wide variety of homemade pastas in the freezer counter (I just wish they sold some fresh stuff daily too!!  There's nothing like fresh-made homemade ravioli).   Their dessert and pastry counter is very good, as is their selection of fresh made Stromboli and tomato pie (although I like mine a bit thinner a la Gaeta's and Cacia's in Philly).   Last week I tried one of their hoagies for this first time, on their seeded semolina bread.  It was outstanding.  Finally, although their fresh meat selection is smaller than the full butcher shop in their Warminster store, what they carry is always high-quality.  Homemade sausages, prime and choice steaks, and Bell and Evans Chicken.",5,Yelp
March,2014,You feel like you walked into Italy when you step inside.The food is outstanding. Please go here for all things Italian!!!,5,Yelp
February,2014,"There's something about an old-fashioned Italian deli that even great stores like Wegmans can't replicate. The busy deli counter has gourmet imported meats and cheeses along with regular staple items. You can pick from 4 or 5 different types of Prosciutto and no one will give you a 2nd look when you ask for Gabagool. The prepared foods counter has the best potato salad on the planet, many kinds of pasta salad, and killer meatballs in sauce. You can buy homemade pasta sauce and hard-to-find white anchovies packed in vinegar. The noise and delicious aroma of this tiny deli make shopping there a delightful and memorable experience. If you live in Doylestown, this is a must visit location.",5,Yelp
December,2013,Excellent fresh meats and side dishes. The deli workers are quick and courteous. The pastries and breads are fresh and tasty. There is no real reason to go anywhere else.,5,Yelp
November,2013,"I love Altomone's. There sandwiches, pastry and homemade Stromboli are awesome!!! It's worth the trip!!! My dad works nearby and comes home with products from here a lot. I can't tell you how many different cheeses I've tried from this place! My dad usually brings home their biscotti. My favorites are the chocolate chip, the cranberry with chip, and the chocolate covered! Altomonte's has take out salads; I have found their salads to brown easily. They are not recommended. I've bought numerous salads there, and when I get home I find out that they are spoiled!So why the four star, and not a five star ( which if it weren't for this little tid bit, the rating would have been a 5 star), well, because while shopping in the store I have noticed expiration dates that have passed. They keep their shelves stocked with spoiled food! Several time I have been in the store and had to search hard to find a product that the expiration date hadn't passed, or wasn't expiring the next day. I would think an establishment  like this would make sure their establishment was sanitary!",4,Yelp
August,2013,This is a great Italian market. Everything is fresh. Their own deli meats are great especially the hot and spicy home roast turkey. Be careful with special orders they tend to be wrong but off the menu is great.,3,Yelp
August,2013,"Talk about a ""WOW"" experience. First time I left this store I couldnt believe it. I have never felt more welcome in a foreign atmosphere in my life. Everyone is there to help you. I was taking a look at the canoli's and noticed the size that I wanted; only issue is they had one left. This is when the girl behind the counter offered to make a fresh one if I wanted more than what they had left. Before you say big deal, this was about 15min before closing when everyone just wants to leave. Left a big impression on my wife and I. Cant wait to stop back. Keep up the good work!",5,Yelp

September,2011,"You walk in to Altomonte's and the wonderful food smells consume you in the most tantalizing way.  Your eyes don't know where to turn to first. Mine have a tendency to go right to the bakery section.  Reasonably priced, delicious dessert options live here. They look so sweet, you instantly want to take them all home with you. The deli is fantastic, the prices are better than the big chain grocery stores.  All of the hot items look fresh, not like they've been sitting in a big bowl that get a good ""stirring"" every few hours.   The meat and chicken is top notch, I have never been disappointed.  The homemade pasta beats having to make it yourself and worry about making a mess in your own kitchen. The shelves of packaged goods are neatly arranged and meticulously straightened and cared for.  Everyone who works here is happy to help, make suggestions and they do it all with a smile.  Trust me, you'll go home happy after you visit Altomonte's.",5,Yelp
August,2011,"Great Italian Market.  Help!  I'm addicted to this place.  Their pre made dishes make our weekends easy.  Fresh cooked pasta, meatballs, sausage, and lasagna every day.  Nice staff as well.",5,Yelp
January,2011,"10 PLUS stars! This is the most awesome, coolest, unique, fantastic, and twenty other adjectives to describe how tremendous this market is! I have never been so impressed and enthused about shopping before!

For thirty five years this Italian family has been operating and until early December of last year, I have been missing out. They have two locations, this is the original store, the other being a couple of towns over in Warminster and I have since been to that location as well.

Why is it so awesome you ask? I discovered them on line when I was searching for a USDA Prime standing rib roast, which I had planned on dry aging myself and they said why go through all that bother, we have our own box where we hang and dry age sides of beef for you! Okay, I gave it a try and honestly it was the very best prime rib we have ever had. Since I was having two Christmas dinners I ordered the full 7 rib king cut and it was outstanding!

But this market is incredible, each and every area of it! From soup to nuts, they have it all going on! Homemade soups with such a large selection, both fresh and frozen, pasta sauces galore, the very best selection of olives, cheeses and salami and prosciutto. Their deli is huge and has won best of Philly, Buck's County and Montgomery County and is loaded with homemade Italian dishes, beautiful meats and cheeses and they bake their own breads and rolls. They have an area with hot foods and cold foods, they will make you a wonderful sandwich stuffed to the brim and their sausage, peppers and onion sandwiches and cheesesteaks rock! You name it for pasta dishes, chicken or veal and they roast and pull the pork before your eyes. They have a cold section loaded with salads of all kinds and a salad bar for you to do your own thing, as well as another hot lunch area. Their bakery is sinfully tantalizing and oh my heavens the cannoli's are to die for, Italian cream cakes, rum cakes, Italian cookies, Napoleons, biscotti and spumoni! I have never been so impressed with a market in my life and each and every well detailed area had me singing! The butcher shop is the best I have ever laid eyes on, the aisles are narrow, but so well stocked with gourmet food items and hard to find items. They even have a really fresh and well stocked produce area, as well as a huge wall filled with homemade frozen soups, appetizers, sauces and meals ready to store in your own freezer for another day.If you would rather have fresh pasta, sauces and soups they have it for you as well as a really nice selection of seafood. They also do a huge catering business.I just can't sing their praises enough and I might do a little tap dance too! I am surrounded by many really great markets, farms and butchers, but this place really has my attention and they have another huge fan!",5,Yelp
